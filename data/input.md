# Final Fantasy VII synopsis and script

## Synopsis

### Setting

> An energy manufacturing mega-company known as Shinra, Inc. is harvesting the sheer life energy of the Planet (known as the Lifestream) as a simple fossil fuel. The Lifestream is processed and made into products ranging from electricity and heat to Mako and Materia. The latter two materials can work miracles, granting the wisdom of the Ancients to the user. However, the Lifestream, like most other fuels, is finite in supply, and the Planet's lifeforce is being malevolently drained by the constant exploitation of Mako by Shinra. Though aware of the harmful effects, they function without remorse.
>
> However, the real battle lies not with a corporation, but a force much more competent from the distant past. A long-thought dead warrior bent on becoming a god by draining all of the Lifestream from the Planet has risen again and will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
>
> Now a small rebel group emanating from the slums must quell the various dangers toward the innocent, and one mercenary for hire must look amidst the lies and deception and find the man he is within.
>
> Official Introduction

The planet of Gaia "Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)"), referred to simply as "the Planet" by its inhabitants, has three main continents. The planet is a living organism, and its lifeblood is the Lifestream, the liquid form being Mako, that wells in the substrata. Above the surface Mako crystallizes into Materia that allows its users to manipulate the powers of the planet in a phenomenon many call magic "Magic (term)"). Harvesting Mako as an energy source drains the planet of its life, and corrupts life forms, creating monsters#Final_Fantasy_VII "Monster (term)") in the wild.

The planet was once home to the Ancients, who called themselves the Cetra. The Cetra traveled the planet cultivating life wherever they went, and were said to be able to enter communion with the planet itself. At the end of their journey, legends tell, the Cetra entered the Promised Land "Promised land (Final Fantasy VII)"), a place of supreme happiness.

The dominant faction of the world is the Shinra Electric Power Company, a powerful corporation that harvests Mako as an energy source. Shinra is seen as responsible for raising the quality of life for everyone in its sphere of influence. It has its own army, its special force being the SOLDIER, and is present in most parts of the planet. Shinra is opposed by a small terrorist organization known as AVALANCHE "Avalanche (group)") who seeks to stop Shinra from killing the planet by draining the Lifestream.

Shinra's base of operations is the metropolis of Midgar ringed by eight mako reactors that drain Mako for energy. While the upper city is an industrial powerhouse with a generally high quality of life, the lower city is made up of slums and receives little light and its air is polluted. The harvesting of Mako energy has made the area around Midgar a barren wasteland habited by monsters where flowers "Flower (symbolism)") rarely grow.

### Story

Act names used from _Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega_.

#### Act 1: Banner of Revolution

AVALANCHE is an eco-terrorist organization led by Barret Wallace in the Midgar Slums. Barret is a former denizen of Corel#Old_Corel "Corel Prison (Final Fantasy VII field)"), a town destroyed by the Shinra Corporation. AVALANCHE hired a mercenary named Cloud Strife, who claims to be a former member of Shinra's elite special forces team, SOLDIER.

Cloud is plagued by psychic disturbances, and at first shows little interest in AVALANCHE's cause; by his own admission, he is only interested in money. Other members include Cloud's childhood friend, Tifa Lockhart, whom Cloud made a promise to protect back before he left their hometown of Nibelheim to join SOLDIER, and Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge "Biggs and Wedge (Final Fantasy VII)").

AVALANCHE's mission is to blow up the eight mako reactors that ring the city. During a mission Cloud is separated from the others and meets Aeris Gainsborough in the slums. To counter AVALANCHE's attacks, Shinra drops a portion of Midgar's upper plate upon the Sector 7 slums to destroy AVALANCHE's base, killing Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge, and most of the people of Sector 7. Shinra captures Aeris and takes her to their headquarters.

Shinra's management is concerned with the limited repositories of Mako energy available for harvesting, and fascinated with the legend of the Promised Land; a place of legend where Mako flows abundantly. Only a race called the Cetra, also known as the Ancients, are, according to legend, able to find it. The Cetra were all but driven to extinction by the "Calamity From the Skies" 2000 years ago, and Aeris Gainsborough is their only survivor, whom Shinra has been trying to capture for years.

Tifa and Barret, the remaining members of AVALANCHE, join Cloud and storm Shinra Headquarters to rescue Aeris. There, Cloud spots a headless creature called Jenova kept in a tank in Professor Hojo's lab, and reacts to it, though he cannot explain his experience to the others. They find Hojo has caged Aeris with Red XIII, one of his other test subjects, and free them, but the group is captured before they can leave Shinra HQ.

The group is freed from their cells by the surprise reappearance of the supposedly dead legendary SOLDIER, Sephiroth, following the escape of a headless Jenova from her tank. President Shinra is killed during Sephiroth's return, and the young and ruthless Rufus Shinra takes the company's reins. Cloud and his party make a hair-thin escape from Midgar by fighting their way through the ranks of Shinra forces.

#### Act 2: Pursuit

Cloud decides to hunt down Sephiroth to avenge the destruction of his hometown, and the others follow suit. Tifa shares Cloud's hatred for Sephiroth and wants to keep an eye on Cloud as his unstable behavior troubles her. President Shinra had told Aeris Sephiroth is an Ancient, and she wants to seek him out to discover more of her heritage. Red XIII decides to accompany the others until he can return home in Cosmo Canyon.

In the town of Kalm Cloud tells the others his tale of the Nibelheim Incident, or what happened in the town five years ago, but his story is filled with gaps. Cloud tells that five years ago he and Sephiroth had been sent to Cloud's hometown to investigate the local mako reactor where Sephiroth had found Jenova, a creature Shinra took to be an Ancient, and who had been called Sephiroth's mother. Troubled by the discovery, Sephiroth had delved into his past and the Jenova Project "Jenova Project (Final Fantasy VII)")—from which he was born—led by Professor Gast and the deranged Professor Hojo. His findings had driven him insane and, believing himself to be the last Ancient, Sephiroth had taken revenge on humanity by burning Nibelheim to the ground. Cloud's mother and Tifa's father had perished during the incident, and a furious Cloud had set out to confront Sephiroth, but his recollection fails before he can reach the end of the story.

After hearing of a man in a black cape the group follows the rumors to Junon where they are surprised to find Rufus Shinra holding his crowning ceremony. The party disguises as crew members and stows away on the cargo ship "Cargo Ship (Final Fantasy VII)") bound for the western continent. Sephiroth appears on the ship and kills almost every crew member. Cloud and his party locate him as he materializes out of the floor, but Sephiroth doesn't recognize Cloud. Cloud attempts to get answers on Sephiroth's goal, but ends up battling Jenova∙BIRTH, a monster made out of parts of Jenova.

The party pursues Sephiroth across the Planet, but they do not search alone, as Rufus also wants to take Sephiroth in and has dispatched the Turks, a group of Shinra special operatives, to carry out the task. The party runs into the Turks several times, and in Gold Saucer they meet Cait Sith, a fortune teller cat robot, who joins them. Barret must confront his past as they return to the site of his former home town, and in Cosmo Canyon Red XIII intends to leave the party, but changes his mind upon discovering the truth of his father "Seto (Final Fantasy VII)") whom he had thought cowardly, resolving to protect the planet by continuing to travel with Cloud and his friends. Cosmo Canyon is a center of study on the planet and its Lifestream, and Aeris speaks with the elders and deduces Sephiroth is not an Ancient, and that she is the only Cetra left.

The group keeps pursuing the rumors of a man in a black cape and arrives at Nibelheim, finding it fully rebuilt by Shinra and populated by Shinra employees posing as the villagers to cover up the incident five years ago. The town is infested with people robed in black who rant on about Sephiroth, the numbered Sephiroth-clones Professor Hojo had created after Nibelheim's torching to test his Reunion theory. The party finds Sephiroth at the library of the Shinra Manor who asks for Cloud to join him in the Reunion, but Cloud doesn't know what he is talking about.

Sephiroth flees and the group chases him across the Mt. Nibel to Rocket Town where they meet Cid Highwind, an aeronautical engineer whose dreams of going into space had been dashed by Shinra's lack of funding. Rufus arrives to take Cid's airplane, the _Tiny Bronco_. Cid refuses, and the party helps stop Palmer, a Shinra executive, from stealing the plane, but end up boarding it themselves along with Cid, who joins the party. The plane crashes into the ocean and becomes the party's boat.

Vincent is a former Turk who was betrayed by his love, Lucrecia Crescent, Sephiroth's biological mother and a Shinra scientist, and turned into a monster. He sleeps beneath the Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim in penance for his sins of failing to stop the Jenova Project, but joins the party upon learning they might run into Professor Hojo whom he deems culpable for everything. Yuffie is a girl from Wutai Village, a town that fought Shinra dominance during the Wutai War, but has since capitulated. She dreams of restoring her homeland's pride, and joins the party to achieve that.

The party's pursuit of Sephiroth leads them to discover several things. Sephiroth's plan is to use the Black Materia "Black Materia (Final Fantasy VII)"), a Materia so powerful the Cetra hid it away that contains the spell Meteor "Meteor (Final Fantasy VII)"), the ultimate Black Magic that summons a meteorite to crash into the Planet. Sephiroth's plan is to create a wound in the Planet so large the Lifestream will be sent en masse to heal it where Sephiroth would intercept it and take control of the world.

Sephiroth is followed by a group of black-robed fanatics, the Sephiroth-clones, all bearing a tattoo "Tattoo (body modification)") somewhere on their bodies placed by Professor Hojo. Despite called "clones" they are not true clones however, but normal people Hojo had injected with Jenova's cells. The clones' wills have become overridden by Sephiroth's will, as he is affecting everyone unable to resist the Jenova cells in their bodies.

Cloud's party grabs the Keystone required to open the Temple of the Ancients from Dio "Dio (Final Fantasy VII)"), Gold Saucer's owner. During their stay at the amusement park Cloud goes on a date "Date mechanics (Final Fantasy VII)") with a fellow party member and Cait Sith steals the Keystone and hands it over to Tseng, the leader of the Turks, revealing himself a Shinra spy sent to infiltrate Cloud's group. Cait Sith refuses to reveal his true identity and blackmails the others to take him along.

Tseng and his fellow Turk Elena "Elena (Final Fantasy VII)") use the Keystone to access the Temple of the Ancients, but cannot decipher its murals. As Elena departs to report to Shinra, Sephiroth attacks Tseng. Cloud and his party find a wounded Tseng as they arrive at the temple, and regain the Keystone and use it to get deeper into the maze. It turns out the temple itself is the Black Materia, and to make into a usable form, somebody must be left inside while the temple shrinks. Cait Sith volunteers, his body being a robot, and he is destroyed once the temple turns into a Materia sphere.

Cloud takes the Black Materia, but Sephiroth arrives and bends Cloud under his control. Cloud hands the Materia over to Sephiroth and attacks Aeris, and is knocked out by the other party members. Another Cait Sith appears to replace the first, and Aeris leaves the party to find a way to save the world from Meteor now that Sephiroth has acquired the Black Materia.

Aeris travels to the City of the Ancients, the lost city of the Cetra. Cloud is troubled Sephiroth was able to control him, but resolves to continue his journey as Tifa and Barret encourage him to go on. The party chases after Aeris and Sephiroth, and when they find her praying on an altar at the Forgotten City Cloud is almost brought to kill her by Sephiroth's control, only being snapped out of his thrall by the intervention of his comrades.

Sephiroth kills Aeris by impaling her with the Masamune "Masamune (Final Fantasy VII)"). Cloud is enraged, but Sephiroth taunts Cloud, telling him he should not act as though he has feelings. Floating up into the sky, the "Sephiroth" turns out to be Jenova; the person the party hunted and followed since the beginning was Jenova—escaped from the tank in the Shinra Headquarters—taking Sephiroth's form. After a battle with a piece of Jenova, the party pays their respects to the departed Aeris as Cloud lays her deceased body to rest in the waters of the Forgotten City. Cloud decides to continue the journey to complete his revenge against Sephiroth even knowing he may lose control of himself again.

In Icicle Inn the party finds recordings that detail Aeris's birth and Jenova's true nature, as that is where Aeris was born to Gast Faremis and Ifalna. Gast was the scientist who had led Shinra's Jenova Project who had departed the company upon finding a true Cetra, Ifalna, the last survivor. Gast had helped Ifalna escape Shinra and the two had settled in the remote Icicle Inn where Gast had interviewed her on her knowledge on Jenova and the guardians of the planet, Weapons "Weapon (Final Fantasy VII creature)").

Ifalna had told Gast Jenova, which Gast had mistaken as a Cetra, was in fact the "Calamity from the Skies" responsible for the Cetra's dwindled numbers. Jenova is a shapeshifting extraterrestrial organism that had arrived on a meteorite 2000 years ago, creating the large crater to the Planet's north pole. The creature had been sealed away by the last surviving Cetra, and it was from this geological stratum that Gast and his researchers had excavated its body 2000 years later. When Hojo had discovered Gast and Ifalna's hideout he had killed Gast and taken Ifalna and baby Aeris captive. The two had later escaped into the Midgar slums, but Ifalna had perished during the escape and Aeris had been adopted by a slum dweller named Elmyra Gainsborough.

The party follows Sephiroth to the North Crater that had been created by Jenova's fall two thousand years ago. They are joined by Rufus and his gang, arriving on the airship _Highwind_, and a horde of Sephiroth-clones, all of whom Sephiroth slays. After catching up to "Sephiroth" he transforms into Jenova∙DEATH, and after defeating it the party reclaims the Black Materia. Cloud explains to the others that what they had been pursuing was not the true Sephiroth, but can feel he is nearby. Cloud and Tifa go alone, and Cloud hands the Black Materia to a party member remaining behind to prevent himself from being tricked into giving it to Sephiroth again.

Cloud and Tifa stumble upon an illusion of the events that took place in Nibelheim five years ago and Sephiroth shows Cloud was never there, his role taken by a man called Zack. Tifa cannot refute Sephiroth's claims, and Cloud begins to believe they are true. Sephiroth claims Cloud is but a facsimile created by Hojo, a puppet with false memories posing as a boy "Cloud" Tifa knows from her childhood. Sephiroth creates another illusion to trick the party member holding the Black Materia to come to Cloud, who takes the Materia and explains to his friends he is a mere pawn for Sephiroth, yet another Sephiroth-clone. Hojo, who has accompanied Rufus to the crater, is at first interested in Cloud, but upon discovering Cloud doesn't have a numbered tattoo, discards him as a failure, annoyed a "failed experiment" is the only one to have made it to the "Reunion" with the true Sephiroth.

Sephiroth's true body is inside a Materia cocoon, and Cloud hands him the Black Materia. Sephiroth summons Meteor, which awakens the planet's guardians, the Weapons, giant monsters of immense destructive power. As the crater floor crumbles Cloud and Sephiroth's cocoon fall into the Lifestream and the party escapes with Shinra on their airship. Tifa is knocked unconscious and Barret is caught as he tries to take her away, both taken to Junon while the rest of AVALANCHE escapes on their own.

#### Act 3: Turmoil

While unconscious Tifa hallucinates chasing Cloud who disappears into darkness, and recalls how she met him on the Sector 7 slums train station some time before he was hired into AVALANCHE. Cloud had been acting strange and claimed it had been five years since they'd last seen. Although Tifa knew it to be longer than that, she had never confronted him, instead asking him to join AVALANCHE so she would have more time to decide what to do and to keep an eye on him and his strange behavior.

Tifa awakes in Junon seven days later and finds a world in chaos: a meteorite "Meteor (Final Fantasy VII)") looms over the sky, a sign of the impending end of the world. Sephiroth has surrounded the North Crater with a barrier preventing either Shinra or the Weapons from attacking his true body, and the creatures have taken to attacking Shinra's sites of power instead. Rufus, trying to show Shinra is still in control, decides to use Tifa and Barret as scapegoats and publicly execute the pair on live broadcast television. Before the execution can go through, Sapphire Weapon attacks Junon, and Shinra kills it with a direct shot to the face with the Junon Mako Cannon. The other party members, led by Cait Sith, sneak in during the attack to rescue Tifa and Barret, and steal the _Highwind_.

The party finds Cloud suffering severe Mako poisoning in the town of Mideel, where he had washed in by the currents of the Lifestream, an ethereal substance that streams beneath the surface of the planet that is its life energy. Tifa stays behind to watch over him, as she is adamant Sephiroth's story of Cloud being Hojo's creation with false memories is untrue, and wants to help him regain his true self. Cid leads the party to claim Shinra's Huge Materia "Huge Materia (Final Fantasy VII)"), which Shinra schemes to load onto Cid's rocket and launch directly at the meteorite. Cid doesn't want Shinra to get their hands on the Huge Materia, massive concentrations of the planet's power, and wants them for their own use to fight Sephiroth.

The Ultimate Weapon "Ultimate Weapon (Final Fantasy VII)") crashes in Mideel. The town is destroyed by an earthquake as the Lifestream swallows it and Cloud and Tifa fall in. Being submerged in the Lifestream allows Tifa to travel inside Cloud's subconscious and sort through his true memories and secret desires, such as joining SOLDIER in part to gain Tifa's attention. She confirms Cloud is the genuine article, although not the person he had made himself believe he was.

Cloud had never made it into SOLDIER and had become a lowly Shinra infantryman instead. Embarrassed by his failure, he had not told anyone from his hometown. When he had been assigned a mission in Nibelheim to accompany the SOLDIER members Zack and Sephiroth, Cloud had concealed his identity by always wearing his helmet, and this is why Tifa had not realized Cloud was there at the time. After Sephiroth had learned Shinra had created him from Jenova, he had gone insane and torched the town. Sephiroth had departed for the mako reactor to save his "mother", as Jenova had been contained there. Zack had confronted Sephiroth at the reactor, but lost. Cloud had arrived soon after seeking revenge, and a weakened Zack had given Cloud his Buster Sword to kill Sephiroth with. Cloud had hurled Sephiroth into the Lifestream below the reactor, but had suffered great wounds in the affair and fallen unconscious.

After Hojo had arrived to assess the situation, he had taken Zack and Cloud, as well as the other survivors from the village, to be his test subjects to turn them into Sephiroth-clones by injecting them with Jenova cells. While the villagers had been turned into clones, Zack and Cloud had not reacted as desired, and were deemed failures to be contained in the Shinra Manor. Cloud's mind had been shattered by the trauma of the events and as a result of Hojo's experimentation, and he had merged his ideal self with Zack and Tifa's memories, and replaced Zack with himself in his recollections.

After Cloud had hurled Sephiroth into the Mako pit below the reactor, Sephiroth's body had dissolved into the Lifestream, but his consciousness had been strong enough to remain intact. Sephiroth had thus learned the wisdom of the Cetra from the Lifestream, and begun to construct a new body for himself inside a Materia cocoon at the North Crater. He had mentally taken over the remains of Jenova at the Shinra Headquarters, morphed it into his image, and used it to bring the Black Materia to his true body to summon Meteor.

As Cloud and Tifa are rescued from the Lifestream the restored Cloud returns to lead the party, revealing to the others he is not an ex-SOLDIER, as he had not been mentally strong enough to qualify. If he returns to the Nibelheim Mansion, Cloud recalls how he and Zack had escaped. After being held captive for many years in the Shinra Manor, Zack had broken free, and taken Cloud along as they had escaped the restored Nibelheim, giving Cloud an old SOLDIER First Class uniform to wear.

Shinra had caught up with the pair on a precipice overlooking the Midgar Wasteland and Zack had been gunned down, but the soldiers had ignored the catatonic Cloud and left him for dead. Cloud had crawled over to Zack's body and taken his Buster Sword, then made his way to Midgar alone where he had wandered aimlessly before being discovered by Tifa at the Sector 7 slums train station. At the sight of her Cloud had snapped out of his stupor and made up a new persona as a former SOLDIER First Class to gain a sense of identity and to cover up the gaps in his memory.

#### Act 4: Decisive Battle

Upon hearing the party has been hunting the Huge Materia, Cloud joins the fray. When they storm the launch of Cid's rocket, they end up trapped inside as it takes off. Cid discovers he had been wrong in admonishing his assistant, Shera "Shera (Final Fantasy VII character)"), for ruining his dreams of space flight, and the party returns to the planet on an escape pod. The rocket fails to destroy Meteor, and as the party gazes at their world from outer space they reaffirm their conviction to protect it, deciding to uncover what Aeris' plan to stop Meteor had been.

With help of the Cosmo Canyon elder Bugenhagen, the party discovers the reason Aeris had gone off alone to the Forgotten City. She had planned to summon Holy "Holy (Final Fantasy VII)"), the ultimate White Magic and a counter to Meteor, using the White Materia that had been passed down in the Cetra lineage which she, as the last Cetra, had possessed. Just before her death, her prayer had reached the planet, but Sephiroth is holding back the power of Holy within the Planet Core.

Diamond Weapon rises out of the sea and charges towards Midgar. Rufus and the Shinra Executives have moved the Mako Cannon to Midgar and renamed it Sister Ray to prepare for an offensive against Sephiroth. The cannon destroys the Weapon, and the blast reaches North Crater, breaking Sephiroth's shield. Before dying, the Weapon fires out energy blasts into the Shinra Building, seemingly killing Rufus and creating a power vacuum at the top of his organization. Midgar falls into chaos. Cait Sith pleads for Cloud and his friends' help, and ends up revealing his true identity as a puppet controlled by Reeve Tuesti, a Shinra executive in charge of Midgar.

Cloud's party infiltrates the city to fight Hojo, who has taken command of the Sister Ray. Hojo is trying to re-fire it, even if it would obliterate Midgar. Cloud and his friends fight their way through the remaining forces of Shinra to reach Hojo, who reveals he wishes to give Sephiroth a "boost" from the Sister Ray's power; the party learns Hojo is Sephiroth's father and thus directly responsible for the crisis facing the planet. Despite the power he has gained by injecting himself with Jenova cells, Hojo is defeated.

With only a week until Meteor falls, Cloud asks everyone to come up with their own reason and resolve to keep on fighting, beyond the mere reason of fighting for the planet; should they find one, they may return for the last battle. Cloud and Tifa have nowhere to go and spend the night together under the stars. The next morning, the others return and Cloud thanks them. Reminded of Aeris's hope and smile even in the face of death, the party is driven to ensure her deeds aren't wasted.

The party ventures to the depths of the Northern Cave "Northern Cave (Final Fantasy VII)"), and in the Planet Core finds Sephiroth, blocking Holy from being released. The team triumphs over Bizarro∙Sephiroth, and then Safer∙Sephiroth, a half-human, half-divine form befitting Sephiroth's vision of becoming a god. Despite Sephiroth's immense power, he is defeated.

When party begins to depart, Cloud collapses, his spirit being torn from him to mentally defeat Sephiroth within the Lifestream "Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII boss)"), freeing Cloud of the chains to his enemy. The victory comes too late, and when Holy is released, Meteor has fallen too far for Holy to unleash its full power. Midgar is destroyed in the struggle between Meteor and Holy, but Aeris's spirit commands the Lifestream to congregate and push Meteor far enough away from the planet for Holy to destroy it.

Five hundred years later, Red XIII and two pups arrive on a precipice over the overgrown ruins of Midgar with children's laughter ringing in the background.

### Themes

One of the game's major themes is identity, seen through the main protagonist Cloud and the main antagonist, Sephiroth. Coping with physical and psychological trauma had Cloud assume the persona of his late mentor, Zack, leading to a deep confusion of the multiple personalities that inharmoniously coexist in his mind. Sephiroth is similarly subject to an identity conflict, having been lied to about the truth of his birth, and the discovery of his existence leads him into a downward spiral of madness.

Many of the main characters come to outlive the people and the places they once identified with, struggling to fit in their current reality. Examples of this are Cloud and his past in Nibelheim and SOLDIER, Barret as the leader of AVALANCHE, Red XIII as the protector of Cosmo Canyon, and Cid as Shinra's aeronautical engineer. The cast is motivated by the loss of something that once defined them. The many locales follow a similar arc, the metropolis of Midgar being built over towns whose names have been forgotten, the Upper Junon destroying the fishing industry of the Old Junon, Wutai's descent into a tourist trap, and the mining industry's decline having left behind the people of Kalm and Corel. This could be seen as a larger theme in the game itself, _Final Fantasy VII_ breaking new ground in the series.

The game incorporates allusions to a variety of religious and philosophical systems, reflected in character names like Sephiroth (drawn from the Kabbalah) and Heidegger (likely a reference to German philosopher Martin Heidegger), and place names such as Midgar and Nibelheim (both from Norse mythology), as well as numerous references in monster names, such as the Midgar Zolom, a reference to the Midgardsorm (also from Norse mythology). Several references are made to previous _Final Fantasy_ titles, including several character names, such as Cid and Biggs and Wedge, and the repetition of soundtrack motifs, such as the "Chocobo Theme".

Environmentalism and rapacious capitalism are major themes in _Final Fantasy VII_, with Shinra Electric Power Company having taken over the world after discovering Mako energy and becoming the world's only major electricity provider. Whether humanity is truly an important part of the ecosystem is contemplated when Bugenhagen reveals to the party the planet's Ultimate White Magic spell can wipe out anything the planet deems a danger, putting mankind's future in peril, seeing as they have been exploiting the world's nature reserves wantonly.

The party decides to fight for the planet regardless, and in the end humanity's true fate was left ambiguous, with only the non-human member of the party, Red XIII, appearing in the epilogue, although future installments to the _Compilation_ have revealed mankind did survive. The interconnectedness of all life is part of the Lifestream study explored in Cosmo Canyon, and the party realizes this when they gaze down on the planet from space, cognizant for the first time how small their world is in the vastness of the universe, reaffirming their conviction to protect it. The planet itself gains anthropomorphic properties with the Cetra being able to enter in communion with it in a ritual known as "talking to the planet", and in Cosmo Canyon the party can listen to the "cry of the planet" in suffering under exploitation from Mako harvest.

In the end the forces of nature prove greater, as despite all their power Shinra crumbles when faced with the planet's true might when the Meteor is summoned and the Weapons awaken. The collective power of all life is required to save the planet from Meteor, when Aeris, perhaps representing humanity itself, summons the Lifestream to push back the Meteor allowing Holy to destroy it.

Art design and world building depict Gaia as a cyberpunk-like speculative or near future setting where magic and fantasy co-exist. While it is popular to depict magic and technology as diametrically opposed, such juxtaposition has been studied to be born of perspectives of the world centered on psychological biases and fallacies geared towards common denominator "normalcy" due to the historic effects of popular psychology and the confines of societal adherent mindsets, specifically regarding the natural world and human agency, and the origination of European and Middle Eastern sciences from studies of nature and physics once considered to be the studies of magic and the supernatural. Within _Final Fantasy VII_, both are at the command of mankind, and the Shinra Electric Power Company holds almost complete control over human civilization. Many "traditional" fantasy elements are also depicted with a touch of modern street art, pop art, commercial graphic design, and modernity-based imagination, showing how mankind's reaches can also influence nature and even the supernatural.

The rise and fall of Midgar and the Shinra Electric Power Company bring to mind the rise and fall of celebrated empires touted for their advancements in technologies that projected power across the world, and met their end of reign by varying causes of decadence, incompetence, and corruption. The summoning of Meteor, as well as the ensuing foreboding global panic and despair its presence brings, are also evocative of popular awareness of "the end of modern civilization", regardless of form, made popular by environmental concerns and heightened information of the effects of human consumption onto the planet during the 1990s. While mankind continues to exist and go its own way, by the end of _Final Fantasy VII_, the Shinra Electric Power Company's hold on the planet is dispersed, marking the ruins of Midgar into the history books as another ancient civilization lost to time.

She stands and walks out into the streets of Midgar as the camera pans back to show the city in full before again diving in, this time following a train as it pulls into a station in Sector 8. Biggs and Jessie leap off first, taking out the two guards stationed there. Wedge follows, and the three of them run ahead. Barret and Cloud leap down last.

**Barret**  
C'mon newcomer. Follow me.

Barret runs ahead. Cloud follows, taking out two guards who stand in his path. He joins Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie at the gate to the reactor complex, where Jessie is working to open the door.

**Biggs**  
Wow\! You used to be in SOLDIER all right\! ...Not everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE.

**Jessie**  
SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?  
What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?

**Biggs**  
Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER.  
He quit them and now is one of us.  
Didn't catch your name...

**Cloud**  
...Cloud.

**Biggs**  
Cloud, eh? I'm...

**Cloud**  
I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over... I'm outta here.

Barret comes running over.

**Barret**  
The hell you all doin'\!? I thought I told you never to move in a group\!  
Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge in front of it.

Jessie opens the door and she, Biggs, and Wedge run through. Barret turns back to Cloud.

**Barret**  
Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya\!  
If you push the Directional button while pushing the \[CANCEL\] button to run. (earlier marked X)

Barret runs on ahead. Cloud looks up at the reactor before following. In front of the reactor, everyone but Wedge heads across the bridge inside.

**Wedge**  
I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the mission, Cloud.  
Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace up? This'll be somethin' to see\!

Cloud follows the others into the reactor.

**Barret**  
Yo\! This your first time in a reactor?

**Cloud**  
No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know.

**Barret**  
The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it every day.

Cloud shrugs.

**Barret**  
It's the life blood of this planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines.

**Cloud**  
I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry.

**Barret**  
That's it\! You're comin' with me from now on.

**Jessie**  
Biggs and I got the code for this door.

**Biggs**  
Code deciphered.

The first door opens and they run through.

**Biggs**  
Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this code...

**Jessie**  
Code deciphered.

The second door opens, and Jessie, Cloud, and Barret enter the elevator.

**Jessie**  
Push that button over there\!

Cloud pushes the button.

<div class="highlight">

Switch On.

</div>

**Barret**  
Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. And that'll be that.

**Cloud**  
It's not my problem.

**Barret**  
The planet's dyin', Cloud\!

**Cloud**  
The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before security and the Roboguards come.

Barret shakes his fist but says nothing. The elevator reaches the bottom and they exit. After heading down a set of stairs, Jessie hangs back to let the other two continue on.

**Jessie**  
Push the \[OK\] button in front of a ladder to grab on to it. After that, use the \[Directional button\] to move up and down.

Barret and Cloud eventually reach the core of the reactor.

**Barret**  
When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk.  
Cloud, you set the bomb.

**Cloud**  
Shouldn't you do it?

**Barret**  
Jus' do it\! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.

**Cloud**  
Fine, be my guest.

For an instant, everything goes red and Cloud stands on tiptoe. There is a sharp humming noise.

Watch out\!  
This isn't just a reactor\!\!

**Barret**  
......What's wrong?

**Cloud**  
Huh?

**Barret**  
What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up\!

**Cloud**  
...Yeah, sorry.

Cloud sets the bomb. Alarms go off and he looks around.

**Barret**  
Heads up, here they come\!

They enter a battle with the Guard Scorpion.

**Cloud**  
Barret, be careful\!  
Attack while it's tail's up\!  
It's gonna counterattack with its laser.

In spite of Cloud's unfortunately translated advice, they defeat the Guard Scorpion.

**Cloud**  
Come on, let's get outta here\!

<div class="highlight">

Ten minutes to detonation\!

</div>

Heading out, Cloud comes across Jessie, trying to tug her foot free. He crouches down beside her to help.

**Cloud**  
You all right?

**Jessie**  
My leg got stuck.  
Thanks\!

Leg freed, she jumps over him and runs on. Cloud follows her back up the elevator. (If you fail to help Jessie going up, Biggs will tell you "Jessie hasn't come up yet," and you have to go back down to help her anyway.)

**Biggs**  
Let's go\!

**Jessie**  
Code deciphered

They run back through the first door.

**Jessie**  
Alright, be careful.

**Biggs**  
Code deciphered

They all run from the reactor and back across the bridge to the exit where Wedge is waiting. Barret accidentally bowls Jessie over, Cloud helps her up, and they make it through the door just as the reactor blows.

<span id="escape"></span>In the escape passage, the way out has been blocked by rubble, and Jessie is setting explosives to open the way.

**Biggs**  
That should keep the planet going... at least a little longer.

**Wedge**  
Yeah.

**Barret**  
.........

**Jessie**  
OK\! Now everyone get back.

The bomb blows an exit and they leap out one by one. Wedge runs around for a minute as though on fire.

**Barret**  
All right, now let's get out of here.  
Rendezvous at Sector 8 station\! Split up and get on the train\!

Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie nod and run off in separate directions. Barret starts to leave.

**Cloud**  
H, hey\!

**Barret**  
If it's about your money Save it 'til we're back at the hideout.

Barret runs off, and Cloud is left to make his own way to the station. Heading up into a city square, he sees a flower girl (Aeris), who gets knocked down by some people running around in a panic. She gets up, dusts herself off, and walks over to him.

**Flower Girl**  
Excuse me.  
What happened?

**Cloud**  
\- You'd better get out of here  
\- Nothing... hey, listen...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You'd better get out of here.</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Really? I don't know what's going on, but all right.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nothing... hey, listen...</span>  
.........  
\- Don't see many flowers around here  
\- Never mind

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't see many flowers around here</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil...?

**Cloud**  
\- Buy one  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Buy one</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Oh, thank you\!  
Here you are\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Ahh... not again.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Never mind</span>

**Flower Girl**  
What\! Tell me\!  
Uh, excuse me, would you like to buy some flowers? They're only one gil.

**Cloud**  
\- Buy one  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Buy one</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Oh, thank you\!  
Here you are\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Ahh... not again.

</div>

</div>

</div>

The flower girl walks away, and Cloud continues through Sector 8.

**Redhead**  
Just what the hell's going on\!?

**Man with Hat**  
Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see...  
Don't be fooled by Shinra\! Mako energy doesn't last forever\! Mako is the planet's lifesource\! The end is in sight\!  
Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE

Eventually Cloud reaches an intersection, beneath which the railroad tracks run out from a tunnel.

**Soldier**  
Hey\! You there\!\!

**Cloud**  
Shinra soldiers...  
\- Fight them  
\- Later\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fight them</span>

**Soldiers**  
What the?

**Cloud**  
hmph\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Later\!</span>

**Soldiers**  
Halt\!\!

</div>

More soldiers come from another direction.

**Cloud**  
Shinra soldiers...  
\- Fight them

**Soldiers**  
That's him\!

**Cloud**  
hmph\!

**Cloud**  
Shinra soldiers...  
\- Fight them

**Soldiers**  
Over here\!\!

**Cloud**  
hmph\!

Even more soldiers arrive, and they surround Cloud above the railway tunnel.

**Soldier**  
That's as far as you go.

**Cloud**  
I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys.

**Soldier**  
Enough babbling...... Grab him\!\!

As the soldiers lunge for him, Cloud jumps from the street and lands atop a train passing by underneath.

---

<span id="train"></span>Inside the train, Barret, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are gathered in the baggage car.

**Wedge**  
Cloud never came.

**Biggs**  
Cloud...... Wonder if he was killed?

**Barret**  
No way\!\!

**Jessie**  
Cloud......

They lapse into silence for a moment, and then glance up at a drumming noise on the roof.

**Biggs**  
Say, do you think Cloud's......  
Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE\!?

**Barret**  
The hell would I know\!? Do I look like a mind reader?

He bangs his fist on a nearby crate.

Hmph\!\! If y'all weren't such screw-ups...

**Wedge**  
Hey, Barret\! What about our money...?

Barret bangs the crate again.

**(unclear)**  
Uh, nothin' ...sorry.

**(from outside)**  
Ahhh......

They all glance up at some louder banging on the roof. The door opens and Cloud swings through.

**Biggs**  
Cloud\!\!

**Jessie**  
Cloud......

**Wedge**  
Cloud\!\!

**Cloud**  
Looks like I'm a little late.

**Barret**  
You damn right, you're late\!\!  
Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene\!

**Cloud**  
It's no big deal. Just what I always do.

**Barret**  
Shi't\!  
Havin' everyone worried like that you don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself\!

**Cloud**  
Hmm...... You were worried about me\!

**Barret**  
Wha\!?  
I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff\!  
Wake up\!  
We're movin' out\! Follow me\!

Barret moves on ahead to the next car.

**Wedge**  
Hey, Cloud\!\! You were great back there\!

He follows Barret.

**Biggs**  
Heh heh...... Cloud\! We'll do even better next time.

Biggs disappears, too, leaving just Cloud and Jessie. Jessie walks over to the open door.

**Jessie**  
Be careful, I'll shut this.

She shuts the door and turns to Cloud, looking him up and down.

Oh, Cloud\!\! Your face is pitch-black......

She rubs at his face.

There you go\!  
Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor\!

Jessie disappears into the next car. Cloud follows.

<div class="highlight">

Last train out of Sector 8 Station. Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard. Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM, Midgar Standard Time...

</div>

As the members of AVALANCHE run into the car, other passengers leave.

**Shinra Manager**  
This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy...

**Train Bum**  
Huh...? This is my house, so make yourselves at home.

**Bald Man**  
You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?  
The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums.  
...blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this one.  
They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?

**Barret**  
Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up\!

**Biggs**  
It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet.  
I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.  
...YAWN... that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station.

If you try to move on to the next car, a train worker stops you.

**Train Worker**  
Please\!\! You're bothering the other passengers.

**Wedge**  
Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous... and me, too\!  
Cloud\!\!  
Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?

**Cloud**  
\- What do you have in mind?  
\- I wouldn't hold my breath

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What do you have in mind?</span>

**Wedge**  
All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick.  
But after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I wouldn't hold my breath</span>

**Wedge**  
Oh man, that's pretty harsh, Cloud. You really think I won't?

</div>

**Jessie**  
Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me?  
It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.  
I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know, flashy stuff.  
Okay, it's about to start.  
This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.  
It's about a 1/10000 scale.  
The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.  
A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section...  
psst... whisper... whisper (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)  
Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.  
The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.  
Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.  
Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is.  
Phew..., this is next\! Look.  
This is the route this train is on.  
The route spirals around the main support structure.  
We should be coming around the center area, right now.  
At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up.  
It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.  
whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)

A red light starts flashing.

**Jessie**  
Speak of the devil...  
That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area.  
...whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.)  
...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief.

The lights stop flashing.

**Wedge**  
I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.

**Jessie**  
I know\! Next time, I'll give you one I made myself.

**Cloud**  
\- Thanks anyway  
\- Looking forward to it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Thanks anyway</span>

**Jessie**  
Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Looking forward to it</span>

**Jessie**  
Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG.

</div>

**Jessie**  
We're almost there. After talking with you, I really want to do it\!  
I think you've lit my fuse\!

**Biggs**  
...snore... heebeebeeheebee... snore... (Don't act so damn big, Barret... snooze...)

**Barret**  
Look... you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night.  
If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky.

Cloud walks over to join Barret in looking out the window.

**Cloud**  
A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery.

Barret gets up.

**Barret**  
Huh?  
Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you.  
...you jes' full of surprises.  
The upper world... a city on a plate...  
It's 'cuz of that &^\#$\# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'\!  
And the city below is full of polluted air.  
On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.

**Cloud**  
Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?

**Barret**  
Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe...  
'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets.

**Cloud**  
I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to.  
It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it.

<span id="arrival"></span>The train pulls into the Sector 7 station, and its passengers get off.

**Barret**  
Yo\!\! Get over here, all'ya\!\!

If Cloud tries to run off...

**Barret**  
Yo, Cloud\! You lissen up\!

The others group around Barret by the steps down from the platform.

**Barret**  
This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.  
The hard part's still to come\! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion\!  
Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that\!  
Meet back at the hideout\!\! Move out\!

Barret runs off, and Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie follow him.

**Station Man**  
When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.  
People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.  
I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.  
I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.  
That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.  
Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.  
But, that's a story for another day...  
First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.

<span id="exploring"></span>A red-haired couple are standing by the street lamp.

**Guy**  
I'm not letting you go tonight.

**Girl**  
Wow\!

**Guy**  
Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?

**Girl**  
Wow\!  
There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too\!

**Guy**  
......damn.

**Girl**  
What?

Cloud leaves the train station and walks through the sector.

**Man by Fence**  
Hey now\!\! Oops\!\!  
What on earth are you doing? Just butt out......geez\!  
Huh? You came to see it, too?  
There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust...  
Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.  
Hey\!\! Look\! It's huge, ain't it?

Cloud looks up at the support pillar with him.

**Man by Fence**  
Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place.  
This is my place, but you can come here when you want. Bye, bro\!

He runs off.

**Barret**  
Yo, Cloud\! Over here, now\!

Of course, you can ignore him if you want. Some distance from the fence are two soldiers guarding an exit.

**Soldier 1**  
What the hell do you want? You know who I am?  
You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.

**Soldier 2**  
W, wow\! You're great\!\!

**Soldier 1**  
Damn right\!\! Don't waste time talkin's, what I always say\!

**Soldier 2**  
But, uh, I......  
Ah... eh... uhm............ Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance.  
Did I do good this time?

**Soldier 1**  
You gotta be tougher\!

**Soldier 2**  
But, uh, I......

As Cloud approaches 7th Heaven, Barret and the others charge into the bar. Gunfire is heard, and a number of customers run out. Tifa comes out after them and bows apologetically. All the AVALANCHE members go inside but Barret, who waits impatiently by the entrance.

**Barret**  
Heh heh...  
You wanna meet your little baby?

**Cloud**  
\- Little baby?  
\- Out of my way\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Little baby?</span>

**Barret**  
Hey\! Don' act like you don't know what I mean\!  
I'm tellin' you...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Out of my way</span>

**Barret**  
Heh\! Jes calm down.  
Can't have people suspectin' us.

</div>

**Gossip**  
Did you hear?

**Cloud**  
\- Don't care  
\- No, what?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't care</span>

**Gossip**  
Oh, well excuse ME\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No, what?</span>

**Gossip**  
There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor\!\!  
You know what this means?

**Cloud**  
\- Don't care  
\- No, what?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't care</span>

**Gossip**  
Oh, well excuse ME\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No, what?</span>

**Gossip**  
Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me......  
If you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out too.  
Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage.  
An' that ain't all\!\! A lotta innocent people got killed too\!  
If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.  
This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit.

</div>

</div>

**Kid**  
Explosions\! Explosions\! Oh Man\! AVALANCHE is so cool\!

**Johnny's Cousin**  
Oh Jesus\!\! What the hell's wrong tonight\!\!  
I thought that long blackout was strange.  
They say a Mako Reactor was destroyed above.  
I was jes sittin' here drinkin', watchin' the news by myself.  
'n' all of a sudden I get kicked outta the &\*%$ store. What's up with that\!?  
I wasn't even done with my drink. I didn't even pay my bill...

**Johnny**  
Woo...... ah geez, I'm blitzed. I jes love them homemade cocktails. But they sure do creep up on ya.

**A sign to the far left**  
Don't be taken in by the Shinra.  
Mako energy will not last forever.  
Mako is the life of the Planet and that life is finite.  
The end is coming.  
Saviors of the Planet: AVALANCHE

**Cloud**  
What crappy handwriting. And look at all this graffiti\!

**Item Shopkeeper** (from inside)  
We're closed today. Come back tomorrow.

The Weapons Shop is open, however.

**Black-haired Man**  
Hey\!\! What the, YOU?  
Anyone talking to me must be a novice.

**Cloud**  
\- Yep, that's me  
\- I used to be with SOLDIER, the name's Cloud

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yep, that's me</span>

So what. Everyone's a beginner sometime.

**Black-haired Man**  
Don't act so big, amateur. Seein' as how I'm such a warm hearted guy, I'll show ya the ropes.  
You come back here tomorrow. I got some things I gots ta do.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I used to be with SOLDIER, the name's Cloud</span>

The name's Cloud. Used to be with SOLDIER, I got no business with you.

**Black-haired Man**  
Hmmph\!\! Well, I never heard of ya\!

</div>

Upstairs, the storage area (Beginner's Hall) is closed off.

**Big Man**  
Unn......\!\! Who the hell are you\!? No unauthorized access.  
Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself.  
Do you know what's been going on......?

**Cloud**  
\- What, that again?  
\- ............

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What, that again?</span>

**Big Man**  
I guess you must be sick of hearing it... But it's been so long since there was any real news here.  
You're worried where it's all heading, right?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">............</span>

**Big Man**  
Everything's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor.  
On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality...  
They say they're just out to kill as many people as they can.  
Gyaaaa, Haaa haaa\!\!  
That's a good one, ain't it\!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores\!  
Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' ok.

</div>

**Man in Hat**  
You know what I do? I'll bet you don't.  
You come here tomorrow and I'll tell you.  
Ahh, there just ain't no good jobs here in the slums.  
I wanna go to the upper world.

<span id="7thheaven"></span>Cloud returns to 7th Heaven, where Barret is waiting.

**Barret**  
Ok\! Go on ahead.  
You\! Cloud\!\! Get off your slow-movin' ass\!\!

Cloud enters 7th Heaven, and Marlene hops up excitedly.

**Marlene**  
Papa\!\!

Cloud starts, and when Marlene sees it's him, she runs and hides in the corner. Tifa comes out from behind the bar and hurries over to her.

**Tifa**  
Marlene\! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?

She walks over to Cloud with Marlene hiding behind her.

Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well.  
Did you fight with Barret?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Not this time

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Tifa**  
I should have known.  
He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little.  
I was worried.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not this time</span>

**Tifa**  
Hmm. You've grown up.  
When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you bought a flower...</span>

**Tifa**  
Flowers? How nice...  
You almost never see them here in the slums.  
But...  
A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have...

**Cloud**  
No big.  
\- Give it to Tifa  
\- Give it to Marlene

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give it to Tifa</span>

**Tifa**  
Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful.  
Maybe I should fill the store with flowers.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give it to Marlene</span>

Nothing happens until Barret comes in.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you didn't buy a flower...</span>

**Tifa**  
I'm so glad everyone's safe.

</div>

**Tifa**  
Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy.

**Marlene**  
............

Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are sitting around a table relaxing.

**Biggs**  
Aaah\!\! Nothin' like that first drink after a job.  
Hic\!\!  
Why don't you have one too?

**Cloud**  
\- No  
\- Yeah, why not?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Biggs**  
What\!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?  
Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, why not?</span>

**Biggs**  
Oh\!\! That's more like it\!\!  
Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya\!

</div>

**Biggs**  
Hic...\!\!  
Oh...... Don't tell Barret what I just said.

**Wedge**  
Oh, Cloud\!  
Tifa really knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm......  
Anyway, let me tell you somethin'

**Cloud**  
\- About what?  
\- I'm not interested in your stories

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About what?</span>

**Wedge**  
Tifa always lets me taste her cooking.  
And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly.  
Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'm not interested in your stories</span>

**Wedge**  
Cloud...... ......forget it.

</div>

**Jessie**  
Careless...... You're getting all excited.  
Wonder what for......?

Cloud starts for the door, but has to jump out of the way as Barret comes thundering in.

**Marlene**  
Papa, welcome home\!

He lifts her up onto his shoulder.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you gave the flower to Marlene...</span>

**Barret**  
Huh? Where'd you get that flower?

**Marlene**  
Cloud gave it to me.

**Barret**  
Oh......  
Did you thank him?

**Marlene**  
............  
Thank you, Cloud.  
We'll take care of you.

</div>

**Tifa**  
You all right, Barret?

**Barret**  
Great\!\!  
Get in here, fools\!\! We're startin' the meetin'\!\!

Barret heads down to the basement using the pinball machine elevator, and the others follow. Cloud can wander the Sector a little more before joining them.

<span id="walk"></span>Back at the train station, the couple is still there.

**Guy**  
Hey, come over here.

**Girl**  
But people will...

**Guy**  
Who cares?

**Girl**  
But... There's a weirdo over there.

**Guy**  
Huh?

He turns to Cloud.

Say, you're pretty gutsy.  
Why don't you go snoop somewhere else, Romeo?

Closer to 7th Heaven...

**Gossip**  
Did you hear?

**Cloud**  
\- 'Bout what?  
\- Don't care

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">'Bout what?</span>

**Gossip**  
About that little girl named Tifa and that bar called '7th Heaven'.  
I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop.  
You wanna hear?

**Cloud**  
\- You bet\!  
\- Don't care

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You bet\!</span>

**Gossip**  
That Barret and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes.  
Suddenly, they threw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder.  
It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't care</span>

**Gossip**  
Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't care</span>

**Gossip**  
Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one\!

</div>

**Johnny's Cousin**  
There's a TV in there, but my cheap aunt won't let me in the house. Look for yourself.

**Johnny's Mom** (from inside her house)  
I'm not opening up. Go away\!\!

**Johnny**  
Hey\!\! Open up\! C'mon baby\!\!  
It's me\! Johnny\! Mom\!\!

**Johnny's Cousin**  
Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums.  
But that Barret, busted it up.  
Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam.  
I think it was when President Shinra was on.  
He was on again this morning, too, you know.  
Tifa better watch out for her TV.

**Kid**  
All's quiet\!\! Shh, I'm spying now\!  
OH\!\! There's something\!\! DANGER\!\! ALERT\!\!

<span id="avalanche"></span>Back in 7th Heaven, Tifa's still behind the bar, though the place is empty. If Cloud approaches...

**Tifa**  
Sit down.

Cloud sits.

**Tifa**  
How about...  
...something to drink?

**Cloud**  
\- I don't feel like it  
\- Give me something hard

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I don't feel like it</span>

**Tifa**  
OHH\!\!  
I can make a drink just as good as anyone else.  
Everyone says, my drinks taste the best\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give me something hard</span>

**Tifa**  
Just a minute. I'll make one for you.  
You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely.

**Cloud**  
What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job.

**Tifa**  
I guess not...  
You were in SOLDIER.  
Make sure you get your pay from Barret.

**Cloud**  
Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here.

</div>

Cloud gets up.

**Tifa**  
Cloud. Are you feeling all right?

**Cloud**  
...yeah... Why?

**Tifa**  
No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.  
You'd better go down below.

Cloud goes down to the basement. Jessie is working at her computer, while Wedge is sitting at the table in the center of the room. Barret is using a punching bag in the corner, and Biggs and Marlene are nearby on either side of him.

**Wedge**  
You think I'm a little too uptight?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah...  
\- No...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah...</span>

**Wedge**  
The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor.  
Cloud, you're great\! Don't you ever get nervous?  
Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No...</span>

**Wedge**  
Well, that's ok. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart.

</div>

The TV near Jessie's computer is on, showing the bombing. President Shinra is in the middle of a speech.

<div class="highlight">

**President Shinra**  
.........today the No. 1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing.  
It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror.  
But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear.  
I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night.

</div>

**Jessie**  
Oops...  
Hey, look at the news... What a blast.  
Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me.  
Oh no\! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.  
Hey, that was my bomb's debut. Makes me kinda proud.

**Barret**  
Yo, Cloud\! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya.  
Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?

**Cloud**  
None. I'm positive.

**Barret**  
You sound pretty sure.

**Cloud**  
If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now.

**Barret**  
Don't you go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER.

Barret lunges for Cloud, and Biggs tries to hold him back.

**Cloud**  
............

Barret throws Biggs off, slamming him against the wall, and stands there seething.

**Barret**  
Yeah, you're strong.  
Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are.  
But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now\!  
Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra.

**Cloud**  
Stayin' with Shinra?  
You asked me a question and I answered it... that's all.  
I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.

**Barret**  
Shucks\!\! ............money...

**Marlene**  
Papa, you're so great\!

Cloud starts to leave, but Tifa, who's come down in the midst of this, runs up to him.

**Tifa**  
Wait, Cloud\!

**Barret**  
Tifa\! Let him go\!  
Looks like he still misses the Shinra\!

**Cloud**  
Shut up\!  
I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER\!  
But don't get me wrong\!  
I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter\!

**Tifa**  
Straighten things up with everyone for me.

**Jessie**  
Money...  
Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it.  
Sure\! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out.  
Oh stop it, Cloud\! Did you hear me?

**Wedge**  
......Cloud.  
You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me.  
Cloud... You just want friends.  
Isn't that right?

**Cloud**  
\- Blow off  
\- I really don't care

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Blow off</span>

**Wedge**  
Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me.  
If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I really don't care</span>

**Wedge**  
You're terrible. Real cold blooded.

</div>

<span id="promise"></span>Cloud goes upstairs and starts for the door. Tifa comes after him.

**Tifa**  
Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you. Please join us.

**Cloud**  
Sorry Tifa...

**Tifa**  
The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely it's dying.  
Someone has to do something.

**Cloud**  
So let Barret and his buddies do something about it.  
It's got nothin' to do with me.

**Tifa**  
So\! You're really leaving\!?  
You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend\!?

**Cloud**  
What......?  
\- How can you say that\!  
\- ......Sorry

**Tifa** (she says the same thing regardless)  
......You forgot the promise, too.

**Cloud**  
Promise?

**Tifa**  
So you DID forget.  
Remember...... Cloud. It was seven years ago...

The scene shifts to show the well in the center of Nibelheim. The sky is bright with stars.

**Tifa**  
Look, the well.  
Do you remember?

**Cloud**  
Yeah... back then.  
I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold.

<div class="highlight">

In the memory, a young Tifa comes to join a young Cloud at the well.

**Tifa**  
Sorry I'm late.  
You said you wanted to talk to me about something?

**Cloud**  
Come this spring... I'm leaving this town for Midgar.

**Tifa**  
...All boys are leaving our town.

**Cloud**  
But I'm different from all of them. I'm not just going to find a job.  
I want to join SOLDIER.  
I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth\!

**Tifa**  
Sephiroth... The Great Sephiroth.

Cloud goes around and climbs up to the top of the well. He nods.

**Tifa**  
Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?

**Cloud**  
...I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while.

Tifa makes a sobbing motion into her hands.

**Cloud**  
...huh?

**Tifa**  
Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?

**Cloud**  
I'll try.

**Tifa**  
Hey, why don't we make a promise?  
Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind......  
You come save me, all right?

**Cloud**  
What?

**Tifa**  
Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me.  
I want to at least experience that once.

**Cloud**  
What?

**Tifa**  
Come on--\! Promise me----\!

**Cloud**  
All right...... I promise.

A shooting star flashes across the sky.

</div>

**Tifa**  
You remember now, don't you... our promise?

**Cloud**  
I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep...... the promise.

**Tifa**  
But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER.  
So come on\! You've got to keep your promise......

Barret climbs up the elevator shaft from below.

**Barret**  
Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER\!  
A promise is a promise\! Here\!\!

<div class="highlight">

Received Barret's stash, 1500 gil\!

</div>

**Cloud**  
This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.

**Tifa**  
What? Then you'll...\!\!

**Cloud**  
You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.

**Barret**  
What......\!?

**Tifa**  
It's ok, it's ok.  
psst, psst...... (We're really hurting for help, right?)

**Barret**  
Uh...... ugh...... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)  
2000\!

**Tifa**  
Thanks, Cloud.

Cloud and the others go to sleep for the night.

---

<span id="day"></span>Cloud wakes alone in the basement and heads upstairs.

**Tifa**  
Good Morning\! Cloud\!  
Did you sleep well?

**Cloud**  
\- Barret's snoring kept me up......  
\- Next to you, who wouldn't?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Barret's snoring kept me up......</span>

**Tifa**  
psstpsst...  
(keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an operation.)

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Next to you, who wouldn't?</span>

**Tifa**  
I don't know what you mean.

</div>

**Tifa**  
I'm going this time.

**Barret**  
Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first.  
I'll fill you in on the train.  
Yo\! Cloud\!  
Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you\!  
I, uh,...... I don't really know how to use Materia\!  
I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it\!

**Cloud**  
...sigh...  
\- Ok, I'll explain it  
\- You wouldn't understand

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Ok, I'll explain it</span>

A tutorial begins.

**Cloud**  
Sure, I'll explain how Materia works.  
First, access the menu.  
You know the basic functions.  
The triangle button brings up the menu.  
Directional buttons move the cursor,  
like this.  
Select each menu by using the OK button.  
If you want to leave the menu,  
just push the CANCEL button.  
See? Let's go ahead.  
Now you're in this menu.  
Select \[Materia\] sub menu.  
Select who you want to use it.  
Now look at my weapon here.  
Each weapon and armor has slots in it.  
Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.  
Now select the Materia you want to use.  
This is curative Materia.  
If you want to know what its effect is,  
line the cursor up with \[Check\],  
and push the OK button.  
It's just like selecting battle commands.  
Just line the cursor up to \[Magic\],  
you can see that the available magic has increased.  
Now you can use new magic \[Cure\].  
And that's all there is to equipping Materia.  
See? It wasn't that tough\!  
When you want to remove any Materia,  
it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,  
and pushing the triangle button.  
There's just one thing you have to be careful of.  
Whenever you equip Materia,  
your situation changes.  
Parts of you may become stronger...  
while others get weaker.  
Normally, when you equip \[Magic\] Materia,  
your magic power will get stronger.  
But your physical strength weakens.  
So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.  
On the left side of the screen,  
you can see the Materia's effect on you.  
It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia.  
But try out various things.  
Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu.  
Ok, that's about it.  
I'll give you some advanced tips later.

**Barret**  
Shi......\! What's this 'It wasn't that tough\!' crap\!  
I'm clueless......  
Well, you handle the Materia then\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You wouldn't understand</span>

**Barret**  
So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh\!?  
Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia\!

</div>

**Tifa**  
Cloud\! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs.  
He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget\!  
Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone\!

**Marlene**  
All right\!\! Good Luck.  
Take care\!

Cloud and the others leave 7th Heaven together. By now the Item Shop is open.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Ahh... Another slow day......  
If this keeps up, this store's goin' under...  
Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this.  
Oh\!\! Look at this\! This doesn't happen everyday. You a...... customer?  
Yes\!\! Welcome\!\! We sell\! We buy\!

Returning to the Weapons Shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
He, HEY\! Waitaminit you\!\!  
You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'...  
Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean.

**Kid**  
You dried up old geez. You tired?  
Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house?  
There's just one condition.  
You gotta give me some cash.

**Cloud**  
\- 1 gil  
\- 10 gil  
\- nothin'

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">1 gil</span>

**Kid**  
Damn, man\!\! Just forget about it\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">10 gil</span>

**Kid**  
Oh man, oh man......  
Go ahead 'n' help yourself to the room.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">nothin'</span>

**Kid**  
Cheap %\#\*^...

</div>

<span id="beginner"></span>**Black-haired Man**  
Heh heh... He'll forget about it. OH, you\!\!  
Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya.

On the second floor, the Beginner's Hall is open.

**Big Man**  
This is the Beginner's Hall.  
You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.

**Cloud**  
Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you how much I know... an' for free too\!  
What do you want to know?  
\- How to save?  
\- How to heal your allies?  
\- Curative Magic?  
\- Weapons and armor?  
\- How to apply Materia?  
\- Effective ways to use Materia?  
\- How to form your battle party?  
\- How to check your status?  
\- About Limit status?  
\- Other things to watch for?  
\- That's all

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How to save?</span>

**Cloud**  
Now I'll tell you about saving.  
You know what'll happen if you don't save?  
That's right.  
Everything you worked so hard to do will be lost\!  
You never know when there might be a power outage.  
And you've got a long battle ahead of you.  
It pays to save often  
and take breaks when you need them.  
Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games.  
But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any.  
You'll have to get some at a (real) store.  
I guess you already have a Memory card.  
Put the Card firmly into the slot.  
Put it in either the right or left side.  
Then when you're ready, access the menu.  
Select \[Save\].  
Remember you can't just save wherever you want.  
You can only save at places marked \[Save Point\].  
When you find one, a message will appear.  
Whenever you reach a \[Save Point\],  
you'll want to save your game.  
Slot 1 is on the left,  
slot 2 on the right. Choose either one.  
Next, choose your file and save it.  
Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files.  
If you have files from other games on it,  
there will be less room to save.  
The screen only shows 3 files at a time so,  
press the directional buttons to scroll down the list,  
and you can see the rest.  
Remember, the more files you have,  
the longer it will take to load.  
One last thing.  
The Memory card is a delicate device.  
Be careful when handling it.  
Never remove it while saving or loading.  
Don't get mad even if you lose.  
If that happens, just chill out,  
and let your head, and your console, cool down.  
That's all.  
Remember to save often so you don't lose your games.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How to heal your allies?</span>

If you don't have any Potions in your inventory:

**Cloud**  
For my explanation, I'll need a Potion.

**Ghost**  
Man, ex-SOLDIER's sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion...

Cloud will then begin his explanation:

**Cloud**  
You probably already know this but...  
HP is your life force.  
If HP is lost in battle, you're out of commission.  
MP is the source of your magic power.  
If your MP's lost, you'll be unable to cast spells.  
So, what should we do to cure a damaged ally?  
There are three ways.  
First, you can rest at an inn at a nearby town.  
Second, you can use items to help them recover.  
Third, you can use curative magic.  
I'll explain about Magic later,  
but here we'll talk about items.  
Select \[Item\] from the menu.  
Potion restores HP.  
If you can't find where Potion is,  
access the menu and select \[Arrange\]  
to change the order of items.  
You can arrange them however you like.  
Order items you'll use in the field.  
Order items you'll use in battle.  
Prioritize items you can throw in battle.  
Order weapons and armor separately.  
Order by name  
Order by most items held  
Order by least items held  
By the way,  
\[Key Items\]'s are just that,  
items that unlock problems just like a key.  
They're very important items to have.  
Keep that in mind.  
Ok, now select \[Use\],  
Then select \[Potion\].  
Select the person you want to use it on.  
If they're already maxed out,  
you won't be able to use it on them.  
We can restore MP with \[Ether\].  
You use this the same way you did for \[Potion\].  
Just pick a member and use it\!  
The number appearing next to the item name  
tells you how many are available.  
Of course, the more you use, the less you'll have.  
Some enemies will drop Potions or Ethers,  
but you'll want to stock up whenever you're at a store.  
One last thing, if someone in your party gets wiped out,  
either rest at an inn or use \[Phoenix Down\].  
That's all\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Curative Magic?</span>

**Cloud**  
Now I'll tell you how to use curative magic.  
First, access the menu and select \[Magic\].  
Next, select who'll cast the spell.  
Pick an ally equipped with \[Restore\] Materia.  
You can select another party member  
by using the L1 and R1 buttons.  
The function also work in other sub menus.  
Better remember that.  
This is magic you can use,  
monsters you can summon,  
and enemy techniques you've learned.  
Whenever \[Magic\] is selected...  
the available magic appears on the screen...  
So, if you wanted to use \[Cure\]...  
you would select it from the menu...  
then select who you want to use it on.  
I think Potion is pretty expensive, so...  
when you're near an inn and you can restore MP,  
it's better to use curative magic rather than Potion.  
That's all.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Weapons and armor?</span>

**Cloud**  
Equipping weapons & armor is basic to battle.  
Let me show you how it's done.  
Just finding or buying new weapons or armor,  
isn't enough.  
You have to access the menu and select \[Equip\].  
Then, select who you want to equip.  
You can change weapons,  
armor  
and accessories.  
Accessories have special effects.  
Just select what you want to change.  
On the right side of the screen,  
here's a list of what can be equipped.  
You can see the item's effect here.  
Change your weapon with the OK button.  
Make sure it'll increase attack/defense levels.  
Pay special attention to Materia slots.  
The slots that are linked are effective.  
Also check the growth rates of Materia.  
Now when you want to remove an accessory...  
press the triangle button here.  
You should never remove weapons or armor.  
Because you never know when you'll be attacked.  
After you're finished equipping,  
you should re-equip your Materia.  
That's it\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How to apply Materia?</span>

**Cloud**  
Materia can unleash hidden power in humans.  
So let's see how Materia is used.  
First, access the menu.  
Then select \[Materia\].  
Select who you want to use it.  
Pay close attention to my weapon here.  
Each weapon and armor has slots in them.  
Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.  
Now select the Materia you want to use.  
This is curative Materia.  
If you want to know what its effect is,  
line the cursor up with \[Check\],  
and push the OK button.  
It's just like selecting battle commands.  
Just line the cursor up to \[magic\],  
you can see that the available magic has increased.  
Now you can use new magic \[Cure\].  
And that's all there is to equipping Materia.  
See? It wasn't that tough\!  
When you want to remove Materia,  
it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,  
and pushing the triangle button.  
There's only one thing you have to watch out for.  
When you equip Materia, your condition changes.  
Parts of you will become stronger...  
while others get weaker.  
Normally, when you equip \[Magic\] Materia,  
your magic power will get stronger.  
But your physical strength weakens.  
So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.  
The left side of the screen,  
shows the effect of the Materia.  
Try out everything.  
And that's all.  
I'll tell you about some of the finer points next.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Effective ways to use Materia?</span>

**Cloud**  
Access the menu if you find Materia.  
There's a lot of different Materia around.  
This is one of them. It's \[All\] Materia.  
If you equip this alone, nothing will happen.  
It's a little tricky, but I'll tell you anyway.  
Now look at my weapon.  
Look closely at those two slots.  
They're joined together as linked slots.  
You've got to remember to put it into linked slots.  
Different Materia will affect each other.  
But only if the slots are linked.  
Just to show you,  
let's put some \[All\] into one of the slots,  
and \[Lightning\] in the other.  
Now we can use \[Bolt\] on \[All\] the enemies.  
But it's limited to once per battle.  
Combine different things  
and you'll come up with different results.  
Combining \[Restore\] and \[All\],  
will let you use \[Cure\] for your entire party.  
There are also many useless combinations.  
For example, \[Restore\] and \[Lightning\]  
\[Bolt\] and \[Cure\] can be used normally, but  
there won't be any compound effect.  
Specialized Materia like \[All\] is called \[Support Materia\].  
You can tell the difference  
just by looking at the Materia's color.  
This may sound weird, but  
did you know Materia grows on its own?  
Even if one of your allies uses it,  
it will continue to grow with each battle.  
As its level increases,  
so will the effects of the magic you can use.  
I told you \[All\] works once per battle.  
But it can work twice or more as it grows.  
When you get it to the master leve,  
Materia will divide itself, looking like it's giving birth.  
But that master Materia won't grow anymore.  
When you can't take Materia on anymore,  
you'd better sell it or dump it somewhere.  
You can see the useful functions here.  
You can \[Arange\] Materia,  
\[Remove all\] Materia from your weapon.  
You can throw Materia into the \[Trash\].  
Oops, relax\! I wasn't gonna dump it.  
Let's see. This is a special menu for you.  
You can exchange all Materia you have between allies,  
even if they're not in your party.  
Now about Materia's growth.  
The growth rate depends on  
what weapon or armor it's put into.  
Some will double in growth, while others won't grow at all.  
In most cases, the Materia's effect won't change  
whether you put it into a weapon or armor.  
But \[Elemental\] and \[Added Effect\]  
are completely different depending on whether  
they're put into weapons or armor.  
You've got to think about  
what weapon or armor to use, or  
what Materia combinations will be the strongest.  
I remember hearing once...  
about extraordinary Materia somewhere in the world.  
I think I've told you just about everything I can.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How to form your battle party?</span>

**Cloud**  
I'll explain your party's order in battle.  
First, access the menu and select \[Order\].  
Next, select who you want to switch.  
Now, select the position you want.  
This will change their position in battle.  
In this case  
there isn't any advantage/disadvantage.  
But when you select the same person twice,  
it will place them  
in either the front/back row in a battle.  
When they're on the left side of the screen,  
that'll be the front row...  
When they're on the right,  
that'll be the back row.  
When you're in the front row  
and you select \[Attack\]  
you inflict major damage on your enemy.  
But you will also receive greater damage.  
While in the back row,  
although you do less damage to the enemy,  
you also receive less damage.  
For magic attacks,  
there's no difference in damage  
between the front & back rows.  
There is also no difference  
when you use long range weapons.  
It's better to keep weaker members...

He moves the cursor to Barret.

in the back row.  
And that's it. Of course,  
I'm better off in the front row\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How to check your status?</span>

**Cloud**  
You must know your current status.  
That's one of the basics of battle.  
Access the menu and select \[Status\].  
Next, select the member you want to check.  
Were you surprised at the amount of information?  
I'll explain the order.  
First,  
these are your experience points and your level.  
The more experience you get in battle,  
the stronger you become.  
This gauge tells you  
how many points you need to get to the next level.  
If you can't beat stronger enemies,  
raise your level by fighting weaker ones.  
You'll improve your physical and magical skills.  
Next is HP and MP.  
HP is your life force.  
When it reaches zero, you won't be able to fight.  
MP is the source of your magic power.  
Every time you cast magic, you use MP.  
and when you run out of MP,  
you won't be able to cast spells.  
This is called the Limit gauge.  
It shows your anger level.  
When the gauge is full, you can use a "Limit Technique".  
I'll tell you about "Limit Techniques" later.  
You know the battle commands  
are classified roughly into two groups.  
\[Attack\] is for regular physical attacks.  
\[Magic\] and \[Summon\] cast magic attacks.  
Each has attacking power, defense power,  
and escape probabilities.  
The value depends on your equipment,  
and experience level.  
The total effect is on the chart below.  
These are commands you can use in battle.  
And your presently equipped weapons, armor,  
and accessories.  
Press the OK button here one more time.  
There are all types of attacks...  
Some monsters are weak against fire,  
others are weak against ice or lightning.  
The Materia or items you have  
can add these \[Elemental\]s to your attacks  
or protect yourself from them in an enemy attack.  
This chart shows your current attributes.  
Press the OK button here one more time.  
The chart below means \[Added Effect\]s.  
Some enemies will use sneaky attacks on you.  
These attacks change your condition,  
such as...  
sleep, confuse, poison, darkness, petrify,  
silence, small, frog, and so on.  
These conditions disappear after each battle,  
except fury and sadness which will remain.  
To cure these conditions quickly,  
use items or magic.  
There are specific medicines for each condition.  
I know I'm repeating myself but,...  
when you're taken out in battle,  
I mean, when you're almost dead,  
use \[Life\] magic or the item \[Phoenix down\].  
When you change Materia or equipment  
it's best to look here to check on them.  
Mastering Elementals and Added Effects...  
will make your battles safer.  
That's all.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About Limit status?</span>

**Cloud**  
Here are a few hints on limit techniques.  
When an enemy has pushed your anger to the limits,  
you can unleash unimaginable power.  
You know what I mean, right?  
The trick is how to use it.  
Access the menu and select \[Limit\].  
Now select a member.  
Now decide what your limit will be.  
Lower limits have less power,  
but you can use them more often.  
If you set your limit higher,  
you can inflict great damage,  
but you'll have to wait longer.  
After using this technique for awhile,  
you'll improve your technique.  
Your development will change  
depending on how you fight.  
I can't tell you how it will change.  
That's something you'll have to find out by yourself.  
I've heard a rumor about secret items  
that inspire ultimate techniques.  
I don't know whether or not those items really exist.  
That's it\! Try everything out and use what's best for you\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Other things to watch for?</span>

**Cloud**  
You probably know all this. But just in case, I'll go over it.  
Until you get instructions, don't open or take discs out of the PlayStation.  
After you open up the Disc Cover, I can't guarantee what'll happen. That's all.

</div>

If you talk to the dog, you enter a short controls tutorial, and then a finger appears over Cloud's head.

**Cloud**  
Huh? Finger\!? What the hell?

**Finger**  
I'm the position cursor\!\! Call me whenever you're walking around confused\!  
Push the \[SELECT\] button and I'll appear over your shiny little head.

**Cloud**  
Geez, you stand out even more than I do...

**Finger**  
Am I in the way? If so, just push the \[SELECT\] button one more time.  
I'm pretty busy myself, and can't always come when you need me. If I don't show up sometimes, don't get mad.  
Later\!

\[Position Cursor\]  
Push the \[SELECT\] button when you're lost in the field. Usually, the \[Position Cursor\] will appear on the screen.  
But wait\!\! \[Red triangles\] mark the exits and \[Green triangles\] mark ladders. These will help you safely make it through even the darkest streets or dangerous mountains\!  
But, there are times when it won't appear, so be careful.

Across from the man and dog, there is a materia sitting in front of a man with a hat.

<div class="highlight">

Received "All" Materia\!

</div>

**Man in Hat**  
Hey\!\! You got one right off\!  
That was Materia. Next, take this \[treasure chest\]\!

A treasure chest falls from the ceiling. Cloud opens it.

<div class="highlight">

Received "Ether"\!

</div>

**Man in Hat**  
Now listen, Hidden in these treasure chests, are a lot of items  
There are box types and bag types, so make sure you don't overlook any.

Inside the fenced area, a boy and girl are sparring.

**Boy**  
......smack......knock......\!\!

**Girl**  
Help\!

**Cloud**  
You've got to hang in there. You're limit gauge is just starting to build.

**Girl**  
Waaaah\!\!

**Cloud**  
Ok\! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it\! Fight with your limit technique.

The girl starts glowing and pummels the boy, knocking him down.

**Cloud**  
Great\!

**Boy**  
Magic\!\! Magic\!\!

**Girl**  
Help\!

**Cloud**  
Calm down\! When your enemy uses magic counter with \[Magic Barrier\] or \[reflect\].  
\[Magic Barrier\] reduces the damage received from magic by half.  
\[reflect\] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.

The girl uses reflect and knocks down the boy.

**Cloud**  
Great\!

**Boy**  
Wow\! You sure are strong\! I'm going to be strong, too\!

**Girl**  
Me too\!

**Cloud**  
If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia.  
And you have to find the best combinations of them.  
The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows.  
Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless.  
That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent.

**Girl + Boy**  
I still don't get it\!

**Cloud**  
Listen kid, don't piss me off\!  
That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll get used to it.

The kids shrug and go back to their sparring match.

**Three Guys Posing**  
Hey SOLDIER\!\! Tell us about battles\! We'll even pay you\!

**Cloud**  
I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.  
What do you want to know?  
\- About ATB  
\- The numbers on the screen  
\- About \[change\] and \[defend\]  
\- About \[Escape\]  
\- About the gauges  
\- About \[status\]  
\- About \[elementals\]  
\- About \[help\]  
\- That's all the time I have for you\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About ATB</span>

**Cloud**  
ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle.  
Select \[Wait\] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle.  
This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners.  
Selecting \[Recommended\] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle.  
This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you\!  
Personally, I always use \[Active\], but you can use whichever you like.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">The numbers on the screen</span>

**Cloud**  
White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points.  
You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About \[change\] and \[defend\]</span>

**Cloud**  
The \[change\] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows.  
In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less.  
You can make a \[change\] by pressing the Directional button in battle.  
Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses \[defend\].  
Selecting \[defend\] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command.  
If you're up against a strong enemy, Don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About \[Escape\]</span>

**Cloud**  
I don't really remember ever having to use the \[escape\] command... but you'll probably need it.  
Push the L1 and R1 buttons at the same time, holding them down, and you can escape.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About the gauges</span>

**Cloud**  
During battle, there are several \[gauges\] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you.  
\[time gauge\] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle.  
When the gauge is full, you can make your command.  
If you don't want to make one, push the △ button and you can move to the next character.  
It's convenient when you wanna make Barret work.  
The \[limit gauge\] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the \[limit technique\].  
The gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time.  
It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it.  
You probably don't know about it, but there are conditions of \[status\], \[fury\], and \[sadness\].  
When you have \[fury\], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower.  
Keep in mind that \[sadness\] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened.  
\[barrier gauge\] is for specialized magic.  
The top gauge displays \[barrier\] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays \[magic barrier\] or defenses against magic attacks.  
Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear.  
Whenever you use \[barrier\] or \[magic barrier\] make sure to pay attention to the \[barrier gauge\].  
That's it. Remember that for the next battle.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About \[status\]</span>

**Cloud**  
\[status\] means just that. The status of each character.  
I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points.  
Sleep  
You cannot put in a command until you get up.  
Poison  
Steals your HP in battle.  
Fury  
Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it.  
Sadness  
Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it.  
Petrify  
Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out.  
Confuse  
Will attack enemy and ally alike.  
Silence  
Will be unable to cast magic.  
Paralyze  
Stops time gauges, commands.  
Darkness  
Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases.  
Frog  
Become a frog. I hate this one\!  
Hoo... I'm beat.  
\[status change\], since this can be changed with magic and items, you should check it whenever you buy things.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About \[elementals\]</span>

**Cloud**  
\[elemental\] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic.  
It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time.  
I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally.  
Fire  
Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.  
Ice  
Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.  
Lightning  
Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.  
Earth  
Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.  
Poison  
Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies.  
Gravity  
Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit.  
Water  
Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.  
Wind  
Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.  
Holy  
Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.  
If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge\!  
Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true.  
To see what elementals an enemy has, you need \[Sense\] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About \[help\]</span>

**Cloud**  
Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head?  
Well, don't worry. You just need to push the \[SELECT\] button in battle.  
Do that, and the \[help message\] will walk you through the commands.  
It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while. Make good use of it.

</div>

**Woman by Save Point**  
This is the fabled \[Save Point\]\!\!  
At a \[Save Point\] you can use a \[tent\] and/or select "SAVE".  
There's more, too. Look for something called secret.  
Even if you are wiped out, if you save you can restart from that same point.  
That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.  
This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar...  
Once you get the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that.

An image of the save point now fills the screen.

That should be all you need to know about the Save Point.  
I'll probably see you again somewhere on the road.  
Take care\!

A treasure chest drops down to replace the save point.

I'm a \[treasure chest\]\!\! Beginners make sure and keep an eye out for me\!\!

On the third floor of the Weapons Shop, there are some beds. If you haven't paid, the kid runs in after you.

This is a slum, so don't think you can stay for free.

You'd better save when you can.  
That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude.

</div>

<span id="johnny"></span>Back outside, a small crowd is gathered around Johnny. Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, who are among them, run off as soon as Cloud nears. Johnny's mom goes back inside her house.

**Johnny**  
I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better man\! This is goodbye\!  
Hey\! Childhood friend\! You better take good care of Tifa\!

Johnny runs off.

**Johnny's Cousin**  
I hope he doesn't get hurt.  
That worries me the most.

**Gossip**  
Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you from outside the bar.  
Tifa's childhood friend. That's a good one\!

**Kid**  
Ahh\! Now I ain't got no one to pick on\!

Inside Johnny's house...

**Johnny's Dad**  
Ha\! Ha\!...... I wonder if my son's already left?  
When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome it gets.  
You want them to be happy and do what they want while they're young, but being a parent, you can't help but worry...  
I guess I'm not cut out to be a parent yet.  
By the way......  
Where are you from?

**Cloud**  
\- A village called Nibelheim  
\- Who cares?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">A village called Nibelheim</span>

**Johnny's Dad**  
Hm...... you said Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back?  
Something to do with a Reactor accident...  
That was the first major Mako accident, so I remember it really being a hot topic.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Who cares?</span>

**Johnny's Dad**  
Ha, Ha\!...... Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say.  
But if you still have a family, You outta at least write them.  
Even though you may turn your back on your hometown, It'll always be there for you.  
Least that's how I see it.

</div>

**Johnny's Dad**  
Well, you mind leaving the two of us alone?  
I want to enjoy some quiet time together with my wife.

**Johnny's Mom**  
He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was here, but now that he's gone... I kind of miss him.  
......strange, isn't it?

Back outside...

**Kid** (standing by the door to 7th Heaven)  
When it comes down to it... I'm gutless. I'm still just a no good kid.

**Gossip**  
Listen\! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of getting gossip on everyone\!?  
Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care\!  
I'll get a little more information that would poque even your interest. You wait and see\!

**Johnny's Cousin**  
Ah... Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed.  
I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when I'm not drinking.

Further on, to where the two soldiers are stationed...

**Soldier 1**  
HALT\!\! No one is allowed to pass\!\!

**Soldier 2**  
You know, I got some tickets to "Loveless", do you want to go?

**Soldier 1**  
What're you, retarded? Midgar's under martial law now\!

**Soldier 2**  
You mean, you really are concerned for me?

**Soldier 1**  
Hell no\!\! But in case you forgot, we're in the middle of a slum.  
They could be anywhere around, so stay on your guard.

**Soldier 2**  
Right. You mean the AVALANCHERS?  
Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.  
Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it?  
I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam?

**Soldier 1**  
Damn right\!\! blahblahblah......  
Hey shut up for a minute and let me get back to work\!

**Soldier 2**  
............sigh.

**Soldier 1**  
What are you more scared of... AVALANCHE or me?

**Soldier 2**  
Oh, you, of course.

<span id="train"></span>Cloud and the others continue on to the train station. The same red-haired couple is still there.

**Guy**  
I've had it\!

**Girl**  
Me too.

**Guy**  
You know this is the first time, we've ever agreed on something.

**Girl**  
Yes.....

**Guy**  
Well then, shall we......?

**Girl**  
Yes......

They move to embrace, but fall over from exhaustion.

**Guy**

**Girl**  
huff...... wheez

Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie are by the train, and they run inside as Cloud approaches.

**Station Man**  
Morning. Dawn comes and things never change.  
You be careful not to get hurt. Come on back again, hear?  
ALL ABOARD\! The train is about to depart.

Cloud and the others board the train.

<span id="train"></span>Cloud and the others board the train from the Sector 7 station.

**Barret**  
YO\!  
Looks like this ain't no private car\!\! So split up\!\!

Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie run off to another car.

**Shinra Manager**  
...hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck...

The Shinra manager sits down just as Barret runs over.

**Barret**  
You say sumthin'?  
I said, 'you say sumthin'\!?  
Yo, look at that\!\! It got empty alluva sudden.  
What's goin' on?

The manager jumps.

**Shinra Manager**  
DAMN\!\!  
I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you...

Barret pounds the wall above the manager and he jumps again.

**Shinra Manager**  
Y, Y, YIPES\!\!  
You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.  
Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today.

Barret jumps back and aims his gunarm at the man.

**Barret**  
You workin' for Shinra?

**Shinra Manager**  
I won't give in to violence... and I'm not giving up my seat either\!

**Tifa**  
Barret\!\!

**Barret**  
&$\#%\!\! You lucky ^$\#^$.\!

Barret turns away from the man. Tifa runs over and bows apologetically before joining Barret and Cloud.

**Cloud**  
So, what are we gonna do now?

**Barret**  
Shit\! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm...

With a rumble, the train starts moving.

**Tifa**  
Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.

**Cloud**  
So what's our next target?

**Barret**  
Hah\! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work\!  
Awright... I'll tell ya\!  
Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.  
It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.

**Tifa**  
Which Shinra is very proud of.

**Barret**  
We can't use our fake ID's anymore...

<div class="highlight">

Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines. Arrival time at Sector 4 Station will 11:45.

</div>

**Tifa**  
That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.

**Barret**  
Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.  
Got it\!?

Barret sits down, and Tifa runs over to the railway map monitor.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, come over here\! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.

**Train Bum**  
Hmmm......? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house.  
I'm impressed.

**Barret**  
Yo, Mr. know-it-all, big time SOLDIER\! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right\!  
So let's hear YOUR explanation\!

**Shinra Manager**  
Waaaaah\!\!  
Don... don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man...\!\! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this...)

Cloud joins Tifa by the map monitor.

**Tifa**  
Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already...  
It's all right. Come a little closer.

Cloud steps closer, but suddenly a red light starts flashing.

**Tifa**  
That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.

<div class="highlight">

**Tifa**  
What's happening?

**Barret**  
What's goin' on\!\!

Jessie runs in from the other car.

**Jessie**  
We're in trouble.  
I'll explain later. Hurry\! Get to the next car\!

**Barret**  
^%\#@%\! Someone blew it...

<div class="highlight">

**Barret**  
Let's go\! Keep it up\!

**Train Bum**  
Hm?... You'd talk to me even now?  
I'm really impressed. Let me give you a little something as a reward.

<div class="highlight">

Received "Phoenix Down"\!

**Train Bum**  
If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?

Cloud and the others move on to Car \#2...

**Jessie**  
Just run\!  
Changing to Plan 2\!

**Passenger**  
Hey... You guys are rowdy...  
Well, just calm down.

**Kid 1**  
Hyu----n\!\! Hyu----n\!\!

**Kid 2**  
Does this mean we're in a major bind?

**Person**  
Gosh\!\! You're adults, but you're making such noise.  
Please behave while you're in the train.

**Dark-clothed Man**  
Huh?  
The hell?\!  
Do you want this?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah...  
\- My mistake

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah...</span>

Wow\! I won't even charge you...  
Wha-t? Don't get used to it though.

**Jessie**  
Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for\!  
But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it\!

Jessie runs towards the next car, punching some guy in her way.

Hee hee\!\!

If Cloud runs after and catches up to the thief...

By any chance...  
Busted?

**Cloud**  
\- Huh...?

Ok, then. That's that.

**Naked Man 1**  
Brrrrr......  
It's terrible. Who'd expect underwear bandits in this day and age?  
They wiped me out\!

**Naked Man 2**  
Any idea what happened?  
All I know is, when I woke up the 3 of us were butt-naked\!  
But I guess you couldn't relate...

**Naked Man 3**  
That scary broad made me take the bomb.  
Of course I couldn't very well refuse her\!

On to Car \#5, where Biggs is dressed in a suit and hat, Jessie wears a red Shinra uniform, and Wedge is dressed in overalls.

**Barret**  
All right\!\! We made it\!  
Yo\!\! This way\!\!  
Let's go\!\! We're gonna dive outta here\!\!

**Wedge**  
Guess who? It's me, Wedge\!  
Looks like things were a success.  
I look just like my little brother in these clothes...  
I wonder how everyone's doin' now...?

**Jessie**  
It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud?  
Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah...  
\- Not now

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah...</span>

...you look great, just like a man.

**Jessie**  
Yay\!\! I'm so happy ...I think?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not now</span>

Just concentrate on our plan.

**Jessie**  
You're right, sorry.

</div>

**Tifa**  
...Scary... huh.

**Cloud**  
Too late to be saying that now. Why'd you come along anyway?

**Tifa**  
Because...

**Barret**  
Hey you two\! There ain't no time for that\!  
Yo\!\! Ain't no time to waste\!\!  
...do something\!

**Tifa**  
Yeah\!\! I've made up my mind\!  
Watch closely. I'm gonna jump\!\!

She jumps from the train.

**Cloud**  
You don't care if I go first?

**Barret**  
A leader always stays till the end.  
Don't worry 'bout me, just go\!  
Yo\! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt\!  
It's only the beginnin' of the mission\!

Cloud shrugs and jumps. Barret turns to Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie.

**Barret**  
Later\! You take care of the rest\!

Barret jumps, too.

\[[skip to the train tunnel](#tunnel)\]

---

<span id="alternate"></span>There are several alternate scenarios if you don't make it to the last car in time.

If you don't make it past the 1st car...

<div class="highlight">

Car \#1: Locked Down  
Car being sent to the Station

</div>

**Barret**  
C'mon\!\! Hurry your slow ass up\! That's it, huh?

**Tifa**  
Oh well...

Barret opens the outside door.

**Barret**  
We're gonna jump outta here\!\! Follow me\!\!

**Tifa**  
We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.

Cloud scratches his head and follows them in jumping off the train.

**Barret**  
Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.  
We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.  
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn\!  
Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel\!

If you don't make it past the 2nd car...

<div class="highlight">

Car \#2: Locked down  
Car being sent to station

</div>

**Barret**  
What? That's it\!?

**Tifa**  
That didn't do anything\!

Barret opens the outside door.

**Barret**  
We'll jump from here\!\! Follow me, you 'spensive leech\!\!

**Tifa**  
Phew-----\! Be strong\!

Cloud scratches his head and follows them in jumping off the train.

**Barret**  
Oh man...... We were forced to get this far out.  
We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.  
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn\!  
Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel\!

If you don't make it past the 4th car...

<div class="highlight">

Car \#4: Locked down  
Illegal ID will be taken to Station

</div>

**Barret**  
The hell\!? So this is as far as we go...?

**Tifa**  
We were almost there.

**Barret**  
We're gonna jump off here\!\! Follow me\!\!

**Tifa**  
Don't worry\! Don't worry\!

They jump from the train.

**Barret**  
That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught...  
They probably don't realize that we've sneaked in yet. We should get to the reactor in no time.  
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn\!  
Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel\!

---

<span id="tunnel"></span>Back to the main scenario. In the train tunnel...

**Barret**  
Good, so far everything's going as planned.  
Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.  
Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.  
Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel\!

At the end of the tunnel, there are light beams blocking the way.

**Cloud**  
Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go any further.  
After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by the security sensor.

Cloud moves to inspect an airduct.

**Barret**  
That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way\!  
Yo, Cloud, what're we gonna do?

**Cloud**  
\- Look inside closely  
\- Go down  
\- Don't go down

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Look inside closely</span>

**Tifa**  
...There seems to be nothing that'll get us stuck in this duct.

**Cloud**  
Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up here.

**Barret**  
Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.  
Cloud you jes' gotta go.

**Cloud**  
\- Go down  
\- Don't go down

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Go down</span>

**Barret**  
But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't go down</span>

**Barret**  
Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.

</div>

Eventually Cloud and the others go down the hole and come out in the maintenance walkways beneath the Sector 4 plate.

**Wedge**  
Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.

Going up the ladder, they run across Jessie.

**Jessie**  
I'm sorry.  
The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.  
I made your ID card special...... So that's why it happened...  
I put my heart into making it. But I failed.  
Next time, I'll give you something more decent.  
I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it.

Onward, down a different ladder...

**Biggs**  
We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.  
Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor\!

<span id="reactor"></span>They move onwards into the reactor. When they near its core, Cloud suddenly collapses.

<div class="highlight">

In the Nibelheim reactor of five years prior, Tifa is kneeling by her father's body.

**Tifa**  
Papa...  
Sephiroth\!?  
Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he\!?  
Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything\!  
I hate them all\!

She takes Sephiroth's sword and runs farther inside the reactor.

</div>

**Barret**  
Damn man, get a hold of yourself\!

**Tifa**  
You all right?

**Cloud**  
......Tifa.

**Tifa**  
Mmm?

**Cloud**  
No... forget...... Come on, let's hurry\!

Cloud gets up and turns to Barret.

I know. You're my watch, right?

**Barret**  
Damn straight.  
Tifa's old friend... That ain't good enough.

Cloud sets the bomb, and they hurry out of the reactor. Coming out of the elevator, they reach a closed door, and a room on the side with three large buttons.

**Tifa**  
Jessie said we all have to push the buttons at once.

If Cloud fails to push the button at the right time...

**Tifa**  
No good. Let's try it again.

Eventually they succeed and run on out of the reactor. They proceed across the bridge.

**Barret**  
This way\!

He stops when Shinra soldiers come out of the exit he was heading for.

Shinra soldiers\!?  
SHIT\! What the hell's goin' on?

**Cloud**  
...a trap...

Footsteps echo, and they all turn to look as President Shinra walks out of the reactor.

**Barret**  
Presi... President Shinra?

**Tifa**  
Why is the President here?

**President Shinra**  
Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?

**Barret**  
AVALANCHE\! And don't ya forget it\! And you're President Shinra, huh?

**Cloud**  
Long time no see, President.

**President Shinra**  
...Long time no see? Oh... you.  
You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes...  
Tell me, traitor... what was your name?

**Cloud**  
Cloud.

**President Shinra**  
Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each person's name.  
Unless you become another Sephiroth.  
Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant...

Cloud takes a step back.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth......?

Barret runs up, pushing Cloud aside.

**Barret**  
Don't give a damn 'bout none of that\! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon\! Serves y'all right\!

**President Shinra**  
And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you...

**Barret**  
VERMIN\!? That's all you can say... VERMIN\!  
Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet\! And that makes you King VERMIN\! So shu'up jackass\!

**President Shinra**  
...You are beginning to bore me.  
I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner I must attend.

**Barret**  
Dinner\!? Don't gimme that\! I ain't even started wit' you yet\!

**President Shinra**  
But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all.

He snaps his fingers, and a whirring noise starts up.

**Tifa**  
\!? What's that noise?

**Barret**  
The hell is this\!?

A robot zooms in from the left.

**President Shinra**  
Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him.  
I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments.

**Cloud**  
...Techno-soldier?

A helicopter comes up from below to hover near President Shinra.

**President Shinra**  
Now then, if you'll excuse me.

**Cloud**  
Wait, President\!

Shinra climbs onto the helicopter, and it flies off.

**Barret**  
Yo, Cloud\! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him\!

The techno-soldier lunges at Barret and Tifa.

**Tifa**  
Help, Cloud\!  
THIS is from SOLDIER?

**Cloud**  
No way\! It's just a machine.

**Barret**  
I don't care what it is\!\! I'm gonna bust him up\!

They fight and defeat the Airbuster, but it explodes. Cloud falls into the gap in the bridge created by the explosion but manages to catch the far edge with one hand.

**Barret**  
It's gonna blow\! Let's go, Tifa\!

**Tifa**  
Barret\! Can't you do something?

**Barret**  
Not a damn thing.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\! Please don't die\! You can't die\! There's still so much I want to tell you\!

**Cloud**  
I know, Tifa......

**Barret**  
Hey, you gonna be awright?

**Cloud**  
\- (Be strong)  
\- (I don't know if I can hold on...)

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">(Be strong)</span>

............  
You worry about yourselves\! I'm all right, but take care of Tifa\!

**Barret**  
...Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.

**Cloud**  
Stop talkin' like this is the end\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">(I don't know if I can hold on...)</span>

Shit\! Can't hold on much longer. Barret... Hurry\!

**Barret**  
Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it yourself.

**Cloud**  
Barret...

</div>

**Barret**  
Alright, then, later.

The reactor explodes, and Cloud loses his grip, falling into Sector 5 below. Tifa reaches for him, but Barret pulls her back.

......You all right?  
......Can you hear me?

**Cloud**  
......Yeah......

Back then...... You could get by with just skinned knees......

**Cloud**  
......What do you mean by 'back then'?

What about now? Can you get up?

**Cloud**  
......What do you mean by 'that time'? ......What about now?

......Don't worry about me. You just worry about yourself now.

**Cloud**  
......I'll give it a try.

**Flower Girl**  
Oh\! It moved\!  
Whew... Am I glad.

......How about that?  
Take it slow now. Little by little......

**Flower Girl**  
Hello, hello?

**Cloud**  
......I know.  
Hey... who are you?

**Flower Girl**  
Hello, hello\!

<span id="church"></span>Cloud struggles for a second, then manages to sit up. He finds himself in a flower bed in an old, run-down church.

**Flower Girl**  
You okay?  
This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.  
It suddenly fell on top of me. It really gave me a scare.

**Cloud**  
......I came crashing down?

**Flower Girl**  
The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky.

**Cloud**  
Flower bed...... is this yours?

He leaps up.

Sorry about that.

**Flower Girl**  
That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place.  
They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar.  
But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here.  
I love it here.

If Cloud walks to the exit, there is someone just behind the door...

**Reno?**  
I'll give you a little more time.

**Flower Girl**  
......So, we meet again.  
......Don't you remember me?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, I remember you......  
\- Never saw you before

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, I remember you......</span>

\- You were selling flowers  
\- You're the slum drunk

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You were selling flowers</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Oh\! I'm so happy\!  
Thanks for buying my flowers.

Or, if you didn't buy a flower:

Oh\! I'm so happy\!  
You didn't buy any flowers from me though.  
Well, that's okay.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You're the slum drunk</span>

Excuse me, but that's really rude\!  
I don't remember a thing.  
But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.

But I'll forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.

Or, if you didn't buy a flower:

......I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.  
Well, that's okay.

</div>

**Flower Girl**  
Say, do you have any materia?

**Cloud**  
Yes, some.  
Nowadays you can find materia anywhere.

**Flower Girl**  
But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.

**Cloud**  
......good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use it.

**Flower Girl**  
No, I do...... it just doesn't do anything.  
I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's......  
Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?  
After all, here we are meeting again, right?

**Cloud**  
\- I don't mind  
\- Got nothing to talk about

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I don't mind</span>

**Flower Girl**  
Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll just be a minute.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Got nothing to talk about</span>

**Flower Girl**  
......oh, I see.  
Ahhh. I wonder whose fault that is. It takes a lot to grow them, you know. Poor flowers.

</div>

She crouches down by the flower bed. Cloud walks over to her.

**Flower Girl**  
Just a little longer.  
Oh\!  
Now that you mention it......  
We don't know each other's names, do we?  
My name is......  
I'm Aeris, the flower girl. Nice to meet you.

<span id="reno"></span>While they're talking, a redhead in a blue suit (Reno) walks into the church and stops just inside the door.

**Cloud**  
The name's Cloud.  
Me......? I do a little bit of everything.

**Aeris**  
Oh...... a jack of all trades.

**Cloud**  
Yeah, I do whatever's needed.  
What's so funny? What are you laughing at?

**Aeris**  
Sorry...... I just

She notices Reno and stops.

Sorry, bad timing on my part.  
Cloud\! Don't let it get to you\!

Cloud shrugs.

**Reno**  
Don't worry about me.

**Aeris**  
Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard?  
You DO do everything, right?

**Cloud**  
......Yeah, that's right.

**Aeris**  
Then, get me out of here. Take me home.

**Cloud**  
OK, I'll do it... but it'll cost you.

**Aeris**  
Well then, let's see......  
How about if I go out with you once?

Cloud steps back and shakes his finger at her. Then he walks forwards towards Reno.

**Cloud**  
I don't know who you are, but......  
You don't know me......?

......I know you.

Flash of white.

**Cloud**  
Oh yeah...... I know you.  
that uniform......

Three soldiers run enter behind Reno, laughing.

**Soldier**  
......Hey sis, this one's a little weird.

**Cloud**  
Shut up\! You Shinra spy\!

**Soldier**  
Reno\! Want him taken out?

**Reno**  
I haven't decided yet.

**Aeris**  
Don't fight here\! You'll ruin the flowers\!

She runs towards the door to the left of the altar.

The exit is back there.

She and Cloud run through. Reno walks forward across the flower bed.

**Reno**  
They were...... Mako eyes.  
Yeah, all right. Back to work, back to work.

He approaches the exit and then runs back.

Oh\!  
And don't step on the flowers......

**Soldiers**  
Hey Reno, you just stepped on them\!  
They're all ruined\!  
You're gonna catch holy hell\!

In the back room of the church, Cloud and Aeris hurry up a set of stairs towards the rafters. They stop before a broad gap in the floorboards as Reno and the soldiers run in.

**Reno**  
There they are, over there\!

**Aeris**  
Cloud... that one\!

**Cloud**  
I know. Looks like they aren't going to let us go.

**Aeris**  
What should we do?

**Cloud**  
Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left.

He jumps the gap.

Aeris\! This way\!

She walks to the gap and shakes her head. Cloud nods.

**Cloud**  
All right. I'll hold them off.

**Aeris**  
Right. Make sure they don't get through\!

**Reno**  
The Ancient is getting away\! Attack\! Attack\! Attack\!

The soldiers fire at Aeris and she tumbles down to the bottommost floor.

**Aeris**  
Eaygh\!\!

**Cloud**  
Aeris\!

**Reno**  
Think we killed 'em? They shouldn't have put up a fight, I say\!

One of the soldiers advances on Aeris.

**Aeris**  
Cloud, help\!

**Cloud**  
Damn\!

He looks up at the barrels on the rafters.

What's that......?  
Aeris\!  
\- Hold on a minute\!  
\- Fight 'em\!  
\- RUN\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Hold on a minute\!</span>

**Aeris**  
A, all right.

**Cloud**  
Here's a barrel. If I can just push it over......  
Push the barrel?  
\- Yes  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If he pushes the right barrel...</span>

The barrel falls down and knocks over the soldier.

**Soldiers**  
Guuagh\!  
Nwahh\!  
Urkkk\!

**Aeris**  
Thanks, Cloud.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If he pushes the wrong barrel...</span>

The barrel falls and lands on the ground.

**Aeris**  
Oh, Cloud what are you doing\!?

She has to fight the soldier anyway.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fight 'em\!</span>

**Aeris**  
A, all right.

She steps forward to fight the soldier.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">RUN\!</span>

**Aeris**  
A, all right.

She runs for the stairs.

</div>

Somehow or another, Cloud and Aeris dispatch the three soldiers, and then Aeris joins Cloud up in the rafters.

**Cloud**  
Aeris, this way.

He leads her up through a hole in the roof. They stop for a moment outside.

**Aeris**  
Ha, ha...... They're looking for me again.

**Cloud**  
You mean it's not the first time they've been after you?

**Aeris**  
...no.

**Cloud**  
They're the Turks.

**Aeris**  
Hmmm......

**Cloud**  
The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER.

**Aeris**  
This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.

**Cloud**  
They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side.  
Spying, murder... you know.

**Aeris**  
They look like it.

**Cloud**  
But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?

**Aeris**  
No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER\!

**Cloud**  
Maybe you do. You want to join?

**Aeris**  
I don't know... But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people\!

**Cloud**  
Then, let's go\!

They start off across the roofs, Cloud running ahead.

**Aeris**  
Wait... Wait, I said\!

Cloud turns to wait for her to catch up.

**Aeris**  
Puff... wheeze...  
Slow...... down... Don't leave me......

**Cloud**  
Funny...  
I thought you were cut out to be in SOLDIER?

**Aeris**  
Oh\! You're terrible\!

They both laugh.

**Aeris**  
Hey...... Cloud. Were you... ever in SOLDIER?

**Cloud**  
......  
...I used to be. How did you guess?

**Aeris**  
...Your eyes. They have a strange glow...

**Cloud**  
That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako...  
A mark of SOLDIER.  
But, how did you know about that?

**Aeris**  
......Oh, nothing.

**Cloud**  
Nothing...?

**Aeris**  
Right, nothing\!  
Come on, let's go\! Bodyguard\!

They continue on and jump down from the roofs.

**Aeris**  
Whew\! Finally made it off\! Now what...

She looks around.

My house is over here. Hurry before he comes.

<span id="explore"></span>If Cloud runs back into the church, he finds two small children there.

**Boy**  
Um, we're, um taking care of the um, flowers for the um, lady here.  
......is that ok?

**Cloud**  
\- I don't mind  
\- No it's not\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I don't mind</span>

Take good care of them.

**Boy**  
Yeah\!

**Girl**  
Sure\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No it's not\!</span>

That's too much to ask of kids.

**Boy**  
Too much to ask? What's that? I don't get it.

</div>

The children run back to the flower bed.

**Boy**  
They're purty\!

**Girl**  
I'm gonna water them later......

Cloud and Aeris continue through Sector 5. Two men are blocking the way to Sector 6.

**Brown-haired Guy**  
Aaaaah...... what a drag. You wanna go to that store in Sector 6 again?

**Redhead**  
Huh? The hell are you? The hell do ya think you're talkin' to\!\!

Not far from them is a large segment of pipe that's been converted into a small, one-room home.

**Person Outside the Pipe**  
That guy in the pipe's a weird one. No matter what you ask him, he only answers 'uuh' or 'aahh'.

**Aeris**  
This guy are sick.  
He passed out nearby and someone must have helped him here.

She and Cloud step into the pipe.

**Man**  
ooh...... aaah......... aghhhh......

**Aeris**  
This is the one...... Won't you help him?

**Man**  
ooh...... aaah......... aghhhh......

**Cloud**  
Listen, I'm no doctor.

**Aeris**  
No... I guess not...  
Hey... that man has a tattoo. I think it was the number 2.

They go back outside and continue towards her house.

**Man in Straw Hat**  
You ever hear of Wall Market?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Nope

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Man in Straw Hat**  
Oh yeah? Then maybe I should have you pick something up for me next time you're there...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope</span>

**Man in Straw Hat**  
It's a market in the slums of Sector 6. They've got everything you could ever want there.  
If you can get there, that is. The road's something else.

</div>

**Woman Walking Around**  
What am I doing? I'm walking around looking at the ground.  
You find a lot of things people dropped when you look down. You never find them when you're looking up. Right?

Inside the Materia Shop...

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
I don't care if it's scrap metal or materia. We can get anything here in the slums.  
Got a lot of good materia here. Why don't you look it over?

If Cloud tries to look inside the shopkeeper's freezer...

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Hey\!  
Don't come barging into my house and be opening up my freezer\! Didn't your mother ever teach you that?

Inside the Item Shop...

**Item Shopkeeper**  
...stare... ......hmph... we only trade items for gil here.

In a nearby house, a man is watching TV.

**Man**  
Hmph......\! Everything President Shinra says is a lie.  
But then again, you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you call them.  
You can bat it around all you like. But in the end it comes down to wanting to be like those who live up above.  
So who do you believe in? Oneself\! Me\! I never lie to myself, that's for sure\!  
I only believe what I say. That's because I never lie to myself.

<div class="highlight">

And now for the news.  
Due to a terrorist attack by the group named AVALANCHE, parts of Midgar that were temporarily out of power will be restored momentarily.  
Following President Shinra's lead, Mayor Domino also spoke out public against AVALANCHE.

</div>

Upstairs...

**Flyer**  
Turtles Paradise News No. 1  
For delicious wine with a nice ring to it......  
Stop on by the "Turtle's Paradise"\!\!

**Kid Sleeping**  
glug... glug...  
Now... no one... will find it... num...  
The top one... and the bottom one...

Cloud walks to the set of drawers.

**Cloud**  
............  
......huh?  
\- Open the top drawer  
\- Open the bottom drawer  
\- Open the hidden drawer between the drawer

The top and bottom drawers are empty, but in the hidden drawer is 5 gil, which Cloud has the option of taking.

Back outside...

**Person Running Around**  
Outta the way\! Move\! You want something... move into the store\!

Inside the Weapon Shop...

**Man**  
Huh? You want weapons? That's too damn bad......  
I ain't got no weapons to sell ya\! And the reason why is...  
...the weapon store's over that way.

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Take care of yourself. It's the law of the slums. But to do that, first you need weapons, right?

**Kid**  
Toot toot\! Next stop... Midgar Midgar.  
Any passengers getting off on Midgar should please ring.  
You know, Midgar's supposed to be sparkly 'n' springy 'n' sleeky.  
Oh yeah. Someday, I'm goin' there.

<span id="house"></span>They reach Aeris's house and go inside.

**Aeris**  
I'm home, mom.  
This is Cloud. My bodyguard.

**Elmyra**  
Bodyguard......? You mean you were followed again\!?  
Are you all right\!? You're not hurt, are you\!?

**Aeris**  
I'm all right. I had Cloud with me.

**Elmyra**  
Thank you, Cloud.

She turns and walks upstairs.

**Aeris**  
So what are you going to do now?

**Cloud**  
...Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to Tifa's bar.

**Aeris**  
Is Tifa...... a girl?

**Cloud**  
Yeah.

**Aeris**  
A girl...friend?

**Cloud**  
Girlfriend?  
\- No way\!  
\- Yeah, that's right

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No way\!</span>

**Aeris**  
Hee hee hee......  
You don't have to get THAT upset...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, that's right</span>

**Aeris**  
Oh, how nice.

</div>

**Aeris**  
Well, that's... nice.  
Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way.

**Cloud**  
You gotta be kidding. Why do you want to put yourself in danger again?

**Aeris**  
I'm used to it.

**Cloud**  
Used to it\!?  
......Well, don't know... getting help from a girl...

**Aeris**  
A girl\!\! What do you mean by that\!?  
You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say something like that\!?  
Mom\! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.

Elmyra comes back down from upstairs.

**Elmyra**  
But dear... I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind.  
But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now.

**Aeris**  
Yeah, you're right, mom.

**Elmyra**  
Aeris, please go and make the bed.

Aeris disappears upstairs.

**Elmyra**  
That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?

**Cloud**  
Yeah. Rather I used to be...

**Elmyra**  
......I don't know how to say this, but...  
Would you please leave here, tonight? Without telling Aeris.  
SOLDIER... the last thing Aeris needs is to get her feelings hurt again...

Cloud heads upstairs.

**Aeris**  
You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a little  
dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.  
Cloud...  
Good night.

She turns and goes downstairs.

**Cloud**  
Oh, man...

Cloud goes to sleep.

...seem pretty tired......

**Cloud**  
.........\!?

I haven't slept in a bed like this ...in a long time.

**Cloud**  
...Oh, yeah.

Ever since that time.

<div class="highlight">

Flashback to Cloud's house in Nibelheim, where Cloud is lying sprawled on his bed, his mother walking about nearby.

**Cloud's Mom**  
My, how you've grown.  
I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.

**Cloud**  
...Not really.

**Cloud's Mom**  
...I'm worried about you.  
There are a lot of temptations in the city...  
I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.

**Cloud**  
...I'm all right.

**Cloud's Mom**  
You should have...  
an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.  
I think that would be the perfect type for you.

**Cloud**  
......I'm not interested.

</div>

<span id="leaving"></span>Cloud wakes up.

**Cloud**  
...I must've fallen asleep.  
Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself...

Cloud starts past Aeris's room, but if he hits the creak in the floorboards, Aeris runs out of her room.

**Aeris**  
Cloud\! I thought the Turks came back\! Get some rest\!

Cloud goes back to sleep for a bit.

**Cloud**  
Can't get caught this time...

Slipping past her room, Cloud goes downstairs and leaves Aeris's house.

**Cloud**  
Through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. I should be able to do it alone...

He heads through Sector 5 alone, only to find Aeris waiting at the exit.

**Aeris**  
You're up bright and early.

**Cloud**  
How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be dangerous?

**Aeris**  
Are you done?

Cloud scratches his head sheepishly.

**Aeris**  
You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th Heaven.  
I'll take you there. Come on\!

She runs off, and Cloud follows.

<span id="playground"></span>Aeris and Cloud head through Sector 6 and arrive at the playground.

**Aeris**  
The gate to Sector 7's in there.

**Cloud**  
Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?

**Aeris**  
Oh no\! 'What ever will I do\!?' ...isn't that what you want me to say?

**Cloud**  
\- See her home  
\- Take her to Sector 7

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">See her home</span>

**Aeris**  
Isn't that a little out of the way?

**Cloud**  
Yeah, I guess so.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Take her to Sector 7</span>

**Aeris**  
I could do that. But won't I be in your way?

**Cloud**  
What do you mean in the way?

**Aeris**  
Nothing\!

</div>

**Aeris**  
Can we take a break?

She walks into the playground and stops by the slide with a cat's face.

I can't believe it's still here.

She runs around and climbs up on top of it.

Cloud, over here\!

Cloud shrugs and joins her.

**Aeris**  
What rank were you?

**Cloud**  
Rank?

**Aeris**  
You know, in SOLDIER.

**Cloud**  
Oh, I was...

Flash.

First Class.

**Aeris**  
Just the same as him.

**Cloud**  
The same as who?

**Aeris**  
My first boyfriend.

**Cloud**  
You were... serious?

**Aeris**  
No. But I liked him for a while.

**Cloud**  
I probably knew him. What was his name?

**Aeris**  
It doesn't really matter.

The gate to Sector 7 opens, and a chocobo-drawn carriage comes out. Tifa is riding in back, wearing a blue dress. Cloud jumps to his feet.

**Cloud**  
Huh? Hey, back there......  
Tifa\!?

The carriage pulls past them and into Wall Market.

**Aeris**  
That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd...

Aeris jumps off the slide and runs after the carriage.

**Cloud**  
Wait\!  
I'll go on alone\! You go on home\!

<span id="explore"></span>He sighs and follows her into Wall Market.

**Aeris**  
This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find Tifa fast.

**Man outside Honey Bee Inn**  
I just can't make up my mind... Mmm.  
Huh? About what?  
Hmmm, don't make me say it... It's the shop down on the right.

On to the Honey Bee Inn, a brothel outside of which a number of guys are hanging around.

**Johnny**  
Man... Should I go...... or not?  
...I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless\!\!  
Hey\!\! Aren't you...?  
What\!\! You mean you're... too?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, me too.  
\- Don't bring me down to your level

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, me too.</span>

**Johnny**  
You're Tifa's childhood friend, and you brought a new girlfriend to a place like this\!?  
What kind of guy are you\!\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't bring me down to your level</span>

**Johnny**  
What... Me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My last memories of Midgar... you know.  
But... That guy over there kinda scares me.

</div>

**Punk**  
What the hell\!\! You \*%^&\!\! This ain't no \#$\*&^% show\!\! I'm busy right now\!\!  
I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight\!\!

**Shinra Soldier**  
Urrrrgh... no way...... I can't go on.  
Things aren't working out.  
Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it.

**Older Man**  
Welcome\!\! Even unpopular dweebs, like you may meet their destiny here\!\!  
You looking for a girlfriend too?

**Cloud**  
\- You know a girl named Tifa?  
\- This place doesn't interest me.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You know a girl named Tifa?</span>

**Older Man**  
Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl.  
But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.  
Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.  
Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">This place doesn't interest me.</span>

**Older Man**  
Hmm... Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.

</div>

**Redhead in Suit**  
The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. Shoo, shoo.

Back to the main streets...

**Kid by Cat Statue**  
Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?

**Punk**  
Hey boy\! You shore got a good lookin' heifer there\!  
Take her to the Don's place, and you'll make a mint.

**Man Cooking Outside**  
It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.

Inside the automated Item store, if Cloud attempts to use the machine...

**Machine**  
......Beeeeeep...... blipppp......

A machine gun pivots and fires at Cloud.

**Cloud**  
Whoa\!  
...Broken.

Inside the Materia Shop...

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
...We're closed now.

**Man Outside Dress Shop**  
Oh... what should I do... Should I just buy it......?

Inside the dress shop...

**Customer**  
Don't push\! Hooligan\!

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Welcome. Please take your time.

Back outside again, two people are talking across from the gym...

**Person 1**  
All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?

**Person 2**  
All this, belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps picking things up and saving them here.

**Person 1**  
Oh, you mean the owner who even has a tank in his shop.

**Person 2**  
But no matter how you look at it, it's just trash...

Inside the gym...

**Man Using Punching Bag**  
Join the club.  
Try it with us.

**Beautiful Bro**  
Oh dear. I've gained weight again.

**Men Doing Squats**  
All right... 1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm.  
I'm doing my best, bro'\!  
How's... this\!?

Inside the bar...

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Whew, times are bad.

**Redhead**  
...And then...

**Redhead 2**  
Hmm, hmmm, oh really?

**Barkeeper**  
Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter.

**Man Waiting Outside Bathroom**  
Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore\!

**Redhead in Bathroom**  
HEY... someone's IN here... Don't look\!  
Got any medicine on you? I'm too hyper... and...... ugh......

Inside the weapon shop...

**Weapon Shop Owner**  
You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints 'bout how things look.

<span id="plan"></span>At Don Corneo's mansion...

**Doorman**  
This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in Wall Market.  
Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again...  
Hey, and you got another cute one with you\!

Aeris and Cloud step aside to talk.

**Aeris**  
Hey, this look's like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.  
I'll tell Tifa about you.

She starts for the door.

**Cloud**  
No\!\! You can't\!\!

**Aeris**  
Why?

**Cloud**  
You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?

**Aeris**  
Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?

**Cloud**  
Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion.  
But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......

At this point, Aeris starts laughing, but Cloud continues without noticing.

First... we need to find out if Tifa's alright...  
What's so funny, Aeris?

**Aeris**  
Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.

**Cloud**  
WHAT\!?

Aeris runs over to the doorman before he can protest further.

**Aeris**  
Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.

**Cloud**  
Aeris\! I can't......

**Aeris**  
You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry\!

**Doorman**  
A friend, huh...? Sounds pretty good to me.  
That'll make the Don happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can...... heeee, hee hee.

---

<span id="honeybee"></span>Now that they know where Tifa is, it becomes possible to enter the Honey Bee Inn.

**Man outside Honey Bee Inn**  
Nope, I just can't make up my mind. Here, you take this. You won't be able to get in without it.

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Member's Card"

Mmm\! Please, please\!

...Hmm. That's how you'll fool them.

**Aeris**  
.........Hmmmmmmm. So that's how you fooled them.

Cloud runs inside, leaving Aeris behind. Inside, all the women are dressed in bee costumes.

**Cloud**  
............

There is a wind blowing and ominous thunder.

<span class="highlight">Take a peek</span>

**Cloud**  
......Wooo... ow\!\!

Through the keyhole, a figure dressed as a king is pacing back and forth while one of the honey girls lies on the bed. In the shadows of the room are two men in suits and another dressed as a knight.

......The wind's calm now......  
It's the curse of the resurrected Satan... Our beloved Queen does not awaken...  
The time is ripe...  
A legend has been passed on through generations...

**First Speaker**  
Psst...... (Hey, shouldn't we stop him soon?)

**Second Speaker**  
...whisper... whisper... (We have a luncheon with President Shinra...)

**First Speaker**  
Psst...... (You tell him......)

**Second Speaker**  
Psst...... (I can't tell him......)

**First Speaker**  
Psst...... (Come on\!\! Oh, well......)

A legend has been passed on through generations...

**Second Speaker**  
Psst...... (I'm so disgusted with the President.)

......the sought after Promised Land......

**First Speaker**  
Psst...... (It's like this every time we have a business trip to Midgar.)

......One with Blue Eyes...

**First Speaker**  
(We come all the way to Midgar, just for this...)

......and a Great White Sword on his back......

**Second Speaker**  
Psst... (What're you complaining about. You're just holding the lights. I've gotta wear this heavy armor\!)

......Will not lead to the Promised Land......

**First Speaker**  
Psst...... (I know, I know... but it's all part of the job.)  
Psst...... (Oh yeah, did you hear? The President's wife found out about this little hobby of his.)

**Second Speaker**  
Psst...... (Ha, ha...... No way, that's the first I've heard of it.)

**First Speaker**  
Psst...... (Oh, looks like he's done. Man, I'm glad\!\!)

**Second Speaker**  
Geez\!\! Mr. President\!\! I mean, Your Majesty......

There are slapping noises.

**Second Speaker**  
Ohhh...... I'm sorry. Please remove the ancient curse\!

If Cloud takes another look...

**First Speaker**  
First Speaker  
Psst...... (Oh man, not again\!?)

**Second Speaker**  
Second Speaker  
Psst... (How many times IS this?)

**First Speaker**  
First Speaker  
Psst... (I don't even know... whew... the King sure gets into this...)

From this point it repeats the earlier dialogue.

There are odd sort of snoring sounds.

**Cloud**  
......Wooo...ow\!\!

Through the keyhole, an elderly couple is seated together on the bed. In the tub on the opposite side of the room bounces a tiny Cait Sith.

**Old Man**  
...wheez...  
Phew...

**Old Woman**  
What's wrong, Grandpa? You keep sighing.

**Old Man**  
...wheez... puff... You know, Grandma...

**Old Woman**  
You talking about this room?

**Old Man**  
...whew... I know our son rented this for us and all, but...  
It's too nice for us. Big round bed, gorgeous tub, I just can't get comfortable.

**Old Woman**  
Don't worry about it. It's a high class neighborhood, in the Big City.  
You keep complainin' and we'll get in trouble.

**Old Man**  
...wheez...

If Cloud takes a second look...

**Old Man**  
...wheez...  
Phew...  
Hey Grandma. What's the name of the company that our son is working for...?

**Old Woman**  
Oh, Grandpa. Did you forget again...?

**Old Man**  
...heave... Lately, it's getting worse...

**Old Woman**  
It's Shinra, you know, Shinra, Inc.? It's the biggest company in the city.

**Old Man**  
Yeah, if it's the biggest company, it must be something.

**Old Woman**  
Yeah. It IS really something.  
He's doing well, and he told me that he's been promoted to Department Head.

**Old Man**  
Oh... thanks to our son we're able to live in a room like this.

**Old Woman**  
Yeah, I'm really grateful.

If Cloud takes a third look...

**Old Man**  
Well, you wanna go to sleep...?

**Old Woman**  
All right...

**Old Man**  
Good night.

**Old Woman**  
Yeah, good night.

The lights turn out. On any subsequent look, Cloud will only hear snoring.

**Old Man**

Inside the room, there's a translucent Cloud crouching in the corner.

**Cloud**  
Hmm......? You......?

What are you doing in a place like this?

Cloud starts clutching his head in pain.

That's what I want to ask you. Should you be foolin' around here?  
You think problems will just go away just thinkin' about them?

Cloud collapses.

**Lady**  
Oh no\!

You can't change anything by just sitting back and looking at it.

**Cloud**

It's started moving.

Hmm...? They say youth is so long but so short.

He gets up.

Time's up. Bye, bubby.

Cloud gets up.

**Mukki**  
Don't get depressed over a thing like this.  
It happens to me all the time.

Somehow they all get into the tub, and the camera lowers again.

I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me too?

Cloud leaves the dressing room and exits the Honey Bee Inn. Outside, Aeris is surrounded by the men hanging around, but they scatter when Cloud steps out.

**Older Man**  
Uh, sir\!\! It's almost closing time...  
So, please remember any personal belongings.

**Shinra Soldier**  
Uuuuuuuh\! I want flowers too\! But, I get so nervous in front of cute girls...  
It just seems natural to get cautious...

**Aeris**  
Hey\!\! Cloud\!\!

She runs over to join him.

**Johnny**  
Aeris...... Thanks for the flower and 1 gil.  
I'll treasure this\! I'm going to dry it and keep it for good luck.

**Redhead in Suit**  
I bought some pretty flowers from Aeris.  
500 gil, a little expensive. Well, at least I got her name.

**Punk**  
I asked Aeris for a date...  
And she said not even if I paid her 1,000,000 gil.  
Her flowers cost 300 gil, too... She's a good business woman.

<span id="becoming"></span>Back on the main quest. Aeris and Cloud head to the dress shop.

**Aeris**  
Excuse me\! I'd like to get a dress.

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?

**Aeris**  
What's the problem?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses.

**Aeris**  
And, where is your father?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
He's probably plastered at the bar.

**Aeris**  
So... You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.  
\!  
You'd help me bring him back?

**Aeris**  
Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Really\!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore...

**Aeris**  
All right, we'll do something. Let's go, Cloud\!

On talking to her again:

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
So how did it go?

**Cloud**  
We couldn't find him yet.

Heading on over to the bar, they approach a man slouched at the counter.

**Aeris**  
Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
I own the Clothes Shop... but I ain't your father.

**Aeris**  
I didn't say that......

**Cloud**  
Make me some clothes.

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.

**Aeris**  
Cloud, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to him.  
Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.

Cloud turns away.

**Aeris**  
You know, Mister.  
He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl.  
So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him...

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
What\!? A tough lookin guy like that?

**Aeris**  
So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
...might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.

**Aeris**  
Then you'll do it for us?

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?

**Aeris**  
Something...  
\- That feels clean  
\- That feels soft  
And something...  
\- shiny  
\- that shimmers

Depending on her answers, the clothing shop owner makes either a silk or a cotton dress.

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste as him. I'll go talk to him.  
Hey, hold on. Wait till I get an image in my head. Gulp... ummm, that's good.

Cloud and Aeris return to the dress shop, the owner having preceded them.

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Looks like everything went well. He's been making the dress ever since he came back.

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Oh, you're here. It's ready. Go try it on.

Cloud goes into the changing room, and after a few moments of shuffling--

**Cloud**  
How...... do you put this on?

Aeris walks over, peers in, and shakes her head.

**Cloud**  
Whoa\! What are you doing\!

**Aeris**  
It's still not right. A wig\! That's what you need\!

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Umm, I thought you might, so I talked to my friend about getting one.  
You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. Go and talk to them.

Cloud comes out of the dressing room in his usual attire.

**Cloud**  
...'like you'? Aeris, what did you tell him?

**Aeris**  
Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress\!

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
So, how was it? Were you able to see him?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
So? Were you able to get the wig?

Off to the gym...

**Beautiful Bro**  
You the one...... Who wants to be cute?

**Cloud**  
Cute?

**Aeris**  
Right.  
And about the wig...

**Beautiful Bro**  
Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya.

You're right. Let's do squats.  
All right\! We'll beat you out of this gym\!

**Cloud**

**Aeris**  
THE beautiful Bro?

**Beautiful Bro**  
What? You didn't know? Always running around here sayin' Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that...  
Never mind that, come over here.  
No, I'll explain the rules.  
From the ready position, push \[\] Button to squat, push X Button to get up, and push O Button to go back to the ready position.  
So it's \[\] Button, X Button, O Button in that order.  
Got it?

**Cloud**  
\- Don't have it  
\- Got it

**Beautiful Bro**  
Whoever has the most squats after 30 seconds gets the wig.

**Black Man**  
I'm not going to lose.

**Beautiful Bro**  
Just be quiet...  
It's not fair for you to start right away, So, you want some practice?

Oh, now where did I put it?  
All right then.

Nothing happens unless he says "It was all right." On subsequent visits after obtaining the pharmacy coupon, the waitress will say "Thank you very much\!" no matter what Cloud tells her.

**Waitress**  
Thank you. Here's an item coupon for the Pharmacy.  
You can exchange it for one item there.  
We're out of coupons, so we stopped giving them away. Watch out for our NEXT promotion\!

<div class="highlight-nopad">

If Cloud attempts to walk behind the counter...

**Waitress or Cook**  
Please keep out of kitchen\!

Cloud leaves the restaurant and heads to the pharmacy. It takes a moment for the shopkeeper to notice him.

**Pharmacy Owner**  
Whoa\!  
Why don't you say something, if you're standing there?  
Oh, you have a coupon. Then please select any one medicine you like.

**Cloud**

**Shinra Soldier**  
Uurrgh\! So, this is it for today, huh?

**Older Man**  
It's closing time. yawn...... I'm so sleepy......

**Redhead in Suit**  
Sir, is everything all right? Look, Aeris looks so lonely.

---

<span id="misscloud"></span>All items obtained, there is nothing for it but to return to the dress shop...

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Looks like you're all set. Now try it on, and let's see how it fits.

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Looks like you got it. So try it on for size.

**Aeris**  
Aren't you going to change?

**Cloud**  
\- Okay... I'm ready  
\- Not now

Cloud changes in the dressing room and steps out.

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?  
Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, So the dress is on the house.

**Aeris**  
Walk more nicely like... this. Miss Cloud.

**Cloud**  
...What do you mean 'nicely'?

Cloud walks primly around the room.

**Aeris**  
Oh you're so cute, Miss Cloud.  
Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me too?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
How's this?

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
How about that one?

**Shopkeeper's Daughter**  
Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better.

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
No, what are you saying? This one.

**Aeris**  
...I want THIS one.

**Shopkeeper's Daughter + Clothing Shop Owner**  
Huh?

**Aeris**  
I'm going to go change.

She walks to the dressing room, then turns to look at everyone.

......No peeking\!

Everyone stares at the curtain while she changes, and after a few moments she emerges in a red dress with her hair down.

**Aeris**  
So? How do I look?

Cloud just shakes his head.

**Aeris**  
Oh, you're no fun\!

**Shopkeeper's Daughter** (to Cloud)  
...Hmm. It's REALLY somethin'.

**Customer**  
You're...  
Weird.

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
Hmm, good. It looks good on you.

They leave the dress shop and can now wander around a bit without being recognized. If Cloud tries to leave Wall Market, Aeris hangs back.

**Cloud**  
What's wrong, Aeris?

**Aeris**  
...What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but...

**Cloud**  
...Oh, yeah.

**Aeris**  
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. Cloud.

**Punk**  
Hey\! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job\!  
Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune\!

Outside the Honey Bee Inn...

**Men**  
Yeow\!\! Hey, Princess\!\!

All the men run over.

**Johnny**  
Uh... ummm I, I......  
Uh... ummm....  
I'm... Jo...... Johnny... Nice to meet you.

**Redhead in Suit**  
Yeah, I only talk to the pretty ones.  
Mmmm, you're the one. You're just great.

**Punk**

**Older Man**  
Ummm, young girls... soft skin. Ummm, OK, I'm refreshed now\!  
...Mmmm? Pretty hard. You work out?

At the gym...

**Beautiful Bro**  
Ummm, not quite there.

Or:

Ehhhh, so so.

Or:

Hmm, pretty good.

---

<span id="mansion"></span>And finally... off to Don Corneo's mansion...

**Doorman**  
Damn\!\! Your friend's hot, too\!  
Come in, come in\!\!  
Two ladies coming through\!\!

The door opens, and Cloud and Aeris walk through.

**Redhead in Suit**  
Hey, ladies.  
I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go wandering around...

**Aeris**  
Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa.  
I wonder where she is...

Of two doors upstairs, one is closed, and the other reads "Office of The Don Corneo Keep Out\!" Aeris and Cloud go down a long set of stairs to the basement, where they find Tifa. When Cloud sees her, he turns away. Aeris goes over to talk to her alone.

**Aeris**  
...Tifa?  
Nice to meet you. I'm Aeris.  
Cloud's told me a lot about you.

**Tifa**  
...And you are?  
Hey you're the one with Cloud in the park...

**Aeris**  
Right, with Cloud.

**Tifa**  
Oh......

**Aeris**  
Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.

**Tifa**  
What do you mean, 'Don't worry'... about what?  
No, don't misunderstand.  
Cloud and I grew up together. Nothing more.

**Aeris**  
Poor Cloud, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.  
Right, Cloud?

**Tifa**  
Cloud?

If Cloud tries to run away upstairs, Aeris comes after him.

**Aeris**  
Embarrassed? Come on, speak up\!

If Cloud tries to talk to Aeris, she just laughs. Cloud walks up to Tifa, head down.

**Tifa**  
????

She peers at him and then jumps several feet in the air.

Cloud\!?  
Why are you dressed like that\!? And what are you doing here\!?  
Forget that, what happened to you after the fall\!? Are you hurt\!?

**Cloud**  
Hey, give me a chance to answer.  
I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here.  
I'm all right. Aeris helped me out.

**Tifa**  
Oh, Aeris did...

**Cloud**  
Tifa, explain. What are you doing in a place like this?

**Tifa**  
Yeah, ummm......

**Aeris**  
Ahem\!\! I'll just plug my ears.

She walks a short distance away and puts her hands to her ears.

Please, go on with your private conversation.

If Cloud tries to run away upstairs, Aeris comes after him again.

**Aeris**  
Hey, what's the secret?

**Tifa**  
...I'm glad you're OK.

**Cloud**  
Thanks. What happened?

**Tifa**  
When we got back from the Number 5 reactor, there was this weird man.  
So Barret caught him and squeezed some information out of him.

**Cloud**  
That's when the Don's name popped up.

**Tifa**  
Right, Don Corneo.  
Barret told me to leave the lech alone...  
But something's been bothering me.

**Cloud**  
I see. So you wanted to get the story straight from Corneo's mouth.

**Tifa**  
So I made it here, but now I'm in a bind.  
Corneo is looking for a bride.  
Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then... ...and, well......  
Anyway, I have to be the girl... or I'm out for tonight.

**Aeris**  
Sorry... but I overheard...  
If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?

**Tifa**  
I guess so, but...

**Aeris**  
We have two here, right?

**Cloud**  
No, Aeris\! I can't have you get involved.

**Aeris**  
Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?

**Cloud**  
No, I don't want Tifa in...

**Tifa**  
Is it all right?

**Aeris**  
I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger.  
Do you trust me?

**Tifa**  
Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris.

**Aeris**  
Call me Aeris.

**Redhead in Suit**  
He---y\!\!  
It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting\!  
I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays...  
Hurry up, will ya\!

**Cloud**  
I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is......  
Me...... right?

**Tifa**  
You're right, there was no need...

**Aeris**  
...to ask.

**Tifa**  
Ha ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad...  
I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now...

**Aeris**  
They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.

The three of them head back upstairs.

**Redhead in Suit**  
The Don's waiting in his room... Ha ha ha...

They enter Don Corneo's office, where he is seated at his desk, flanked by two lackeys.

**Kotch**  
All right, ladies\!  
Line up in front of the Don\!

Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa line up in front of the desk, and Corneo jumps up.

**Don Corneo**  
Hmmm\! Good, splendid\!

He walks to Aeris.

Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---\!

He walks to Cloud, who turns his head.

This one?

He walks to Tifa.

Or this one?  
Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind\!\!  
My choice for tonight is......

Depending on the items collected for Cloud's disguise, Don Corneo will choose one of the three.

- [Tifa](#tifa)
- [Aeris](#aeris)
- [Cloud](#cloud)

<span id="tifa"></span>Corneo walks to Tifa.

**Don Corneo**  
This little beauty\!

**Tifa**  
Fu, fu, fu... Be nice, Don.

Corneo turns to his lackeys.

**Don Corneo**  
You can have the other ones\!

**Kotch + Scotch**  
Yes, sir\! Thank you sir\!

**Don Corneo**  
Well then, shall we go my pretty\!?

He starts for his bedroom and Tifa follows. After a scene change, Cloud ends up in the basement with a bunch of guys.

**Scotch**  
Hey guys\! We've got guests.  
We'll take REAL good care of you.  
This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo\!

**Men**  
Heeey\!\! Three cheers for Don Corneo\!\!

**Scotch**  
Heh, heh... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?  
...leer...snicker...

**Redhead in Suit** (by the door)  
Whoa\!  
Slow down, what's the hurry? Why don't you stick around... We'll treat you real nice\!

The men crowd around Cloud with arms outstretched like zombies.

**Men**  
Oh your eyes. They seem to... glow. I'm all yours, baby\!  
Come on, baby\!  
Woo-hoo\! I gots ants in my pants wanna do a dance, gotta take a chance and mebbe find romance\!  
Come on, dance with me, beautiful. They say if two people dance together, their hearts will become one, also...  
Hey... you're in pretty good shape. Lookit your tight little bod......  
No, it's more like... muscles...

**Scotch**  
Hey... what's wrong? You want me to keep you company?

**Cloud**  
No... I'm flattered, but no thanks.  
Because...

**Scotch**  
Because......?

**Cloud**  
Because...  
I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you\!\!

Cloud takes off the dress, revealing his usual uniform underneath.

**Scotch**  
Wha... a MAN\!???  
God damn it\! You think you can get away with this\! Get him\! Knock the crap out of him\!\!

Cloud fights off three of Corneo's lackeys.

**Scotch**  
Grr\! C'mon, what's the matter with you good for nothings\!?  
All right now, COME ON\! I'll show you how it's done\!\!

Cloud dispatches Scotch and the other two lackeys. He then hurries back towards the other basement room, where Kotch is chasing Aeris around.

**Aeris**  
No---\!\!

**Kotch**  
Ha ha ha... Wait you\!\!

Aeris runs up the steps towards Cloud, then turns around to give Kotch a shove.

**Aeris**  
I'm so sorry\!\!

**Kotch**  
oh, oh, oh......

He falls down the stairs.

heh, heh, heh...\!\!

**Cloud**  
Aeris\!\!  
\- You all right?  
\- We gotta help Tifa\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You all right?</span>

**Aeris**  
I told you. I'm used to danger.  
To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">We gotta help Tifa\!</span>

**Aeris**  
Ye... yes, you're right... ......let's hurry\!

</div>

**Kotch** (lying at the bottom of the stairs)  
C'mon... just once... I won't tell... I promise\!  
I just wanted to act like I got a cute girl...  
Cute\!\!

In Corneo's room, Tifa is sitting on the edge of his bed while he sits leering at her.

**Don Corneo**  
Woo-hoo\!  
Come, come, don't be so shy...

**Tifa**  
I know......  
But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start...

**Don Corneo**  
Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?  
Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?

**Tifa**  
No... I'm not asking about that......  
Wa... wait a minute\! No, not yet\!\!

**Don Corneo**  
Come\! Come\!  
Aooooooooh\!\! I can't wait any longer\! Here comes papa\!\!

Cloud and Aeris run in.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!\!

Tifa jumps up as Corneo leaps for her, and he lands on his face.

**Don Corneo**  
Wha... what the hell? Who goes there\!?

**Tifa**  
You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?

**Don Corneo**  
Get what?

\[[skip to the interrogation](#interrogation)\]

<span id="aeris"></span>Corneo walks to Aeris.

**Don Corneo**  
This slender little girl\!

**Aeris**  
Don, you've got great taste.

Corneo turns to his lackeys.

After exchanging glances with Tifa and Aeris, Cloud reluctantly follows Corneo into his bedroom.

**Don Corneo**  
Ahh, we're finally alone...  
All right, pussycat... Come to daddy\!\!

If Cloud tries to run away...

**Don Corneo**  
Woo-hoo\!  
Don't be shy. We're all alone now...

Cloud approaches the bed.

Then, wh... what do you want to DO?

**Cloud**  
\- Whatever YOU want, daddy  
\- Don't really care......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Whatever YOU want, daddy</span>

**Don Corneo**  
Oh man\! I can't stand it\! All right, then......  
Give me a kiss\!\! A KISS\!\!

**Cloud**  
\- All right......  
\- Nope, can't do that......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">All right......</span>

Cloud walks over and leans forward to kiss Corneo, not quite touching lips. He shakes his head and tries again.

**Aeris or Tifa**  
Ju---st a minute\!\!

**Don Corneo**  
Wha... what the hell? Who goes there\!?

**Tifa**  
Cloud...  
Were you really......

Cloud shakes his head violently and takes off the dress.

**Don Corneo**  
A man\!? What's goin' on?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope, can't do that......</span>

**Corneo**  
Why? WHY? WHY?

**Cloud**  
Because...  
Because I'm gonna have to use that mouth of yours to give me some information\!\!

Cloud takes off the dress.

**Don Corneo**  
A man\!? You tricked me\!\!  
Somebody get in here NOW\!\!

**Tifa or Aeris**  
Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.

Tifa and Aeris come running in.

**Don Corneo**  
You're the ones from before\! Wh... what the hell's going on?

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't really care......</span>

**Don Corneo**  
You don't like me?  
There... there isn't someone else, is there?

**Cloud**  
\- No, only you  
\- Yes, his name's Barret...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No, only you</span>

**Corneo**  
You sure do know how to make a guy feel good\!  
Then, wh... what do you want to DO?

**Cloud**  
\- Whatever YOU want, daddy  
\- Don't really care......

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes, his name's Barret...</span>

**Corneo**  
No way\!  
Hmm? Barret? That sounds familiar...

**Cloud**  
You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out about. You know, AVALANCHE...?

**Don Corneo**  
Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7 in the slum...  
...and how do YOU know that\!?

Cloud takes off the dress.

**Don Corneo**  
A man\!? You tricked me\!\!  
Somebody get in here NOW\!\!

**Tifa or Aeris**  
Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.

Tifa and Aeris come running in.

**Don Corneo**  
You're the ones from before\! Wh... what the hell's going on?

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

Ummm......

**Don Corneo**  
You don't like me?  
There... there isn't someone else, is there?

**Cloud**  
\- No, only you  
\- Yes, his name's Barret...

</div>

<span id="interrogation"></span>**Tifa**  
Shut up, we're asking the questions now...  
What did your assistants find out? Talk\! If you don't tell us...

**Cloud**  
...I'll chop them off.

**Don Corneo**  
No\! Not that\! I'll talk\! I'll tell you everything\!

**Tifa**  
So... talk.

**Don Corneo**  
...I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.

**Tifa**  
By who?

**Don Corneo**  
No--\! If I told you that, I'd be killed\!

**Tifa**  
Talk\! If you don't tell us...

**Aeris**  
...I'll rip them off.

**Don Corneo**  
Waaaaaaaaaaaah--\! It was Heidegger of Shinra\!  
Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance\!

**Cloud**  
The head of Public Safety Maintenance\!?

**Tifa**  
Did you say the Shinra\!? What are they up to\!? Talk\!  
If you don't tell us...  
...I'll smash them.

**Don Corneo**  
...You're serious, aren't you... ...ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy.  
...I'm not fooling around here either, you know.  
Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.  
And they're really going to crush them... literally,  
By breaking the support holding up the plate above them.

**Tifa**  
Break the support\!?

**Don Corneo**  
You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING  
and everything's gonna go BAMMM\!\! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums...  
I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.

**Tifa**  
They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums\!?  
Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?

**Cloud**  
Of course, Tifa.

They all start for the door.

**Don Corneo**  
Just a second\!

**Cloud**  
Shut up\!

**Don Corneo**  
No wait, it'll only take a second.  
How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the truth?

**Cloud**  
\- They've pretty much given up on life  
\- They're sure they'll win  
\- They don't know what the hell's going on

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">They've pretty much given up on life</span>

**Don Corneo**  
Buuzzzzz\! Wrong\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">They're sure they'll win</span>

**Don Corneo**  
Woo-hoo\! Right\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">They don't know what the hell's going on</span>

**Don Corneo**  
Close, but no cigar\!

</div>

Corneo hits a switch and Cloud and the others fall through a trap door into the sewer.

### Sector 7 - Fall of the Pillar

#### [Conflicts at Shinra HQ](#shinra)

#### [Arrival at the Pillar](#pillar)

#### [After the Pillar's Collapse](#playground)

---

<span id="shinra"></span>At Shinra Headquarters, Reeve is standing before President Shinra's desk on the 70th floor. Heidegger walks up to join them.

**President Shinra**  
How are the preparations going?

**Heidegger**  
Ha, ha, ha\!\! Smoothly, very smoothly\! I assigned the Turks to this.

**Reeve**  
President\!\! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a group with only a few members...

**President Shinra**  
What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?

**Reeve**  
...No.  
But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why...

**Heidegger**  
Reeve, you should flush those personal problems in the morning\!

**Reeve**  
The Mayor's against this anyway...

**Heidegger**  
Mayor?  
He just sits in this building all day feeding his face\! You still call that a Mayor?  
Now if you'll excuse me sir\!

Heidegger salutes and walks out. Reeve takes a few steps after him, but doesn't follow.

**President Shinra**  
You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go somewhere.

Reeve looks at him, and then walks off.

**President Shinra**  
We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then we'll send in the rescue operation care of Shinra, Inc....  
Heh, heh, heh... this is perfect.

---

Having fallen through Don Corneo's trap door, Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa land in the sewers beneath Sector 6. Cloud goes to each of his companions in turn.

**Cloud**  
You alright?

**Aeris**  
Yeah.

**Cloud**  
You alright?

**Tifa**  
Man\! This is terrible.

**Aeris**  
Well, the worst is over...

There is a low growling noise.

**Aeris**  
Maybe not...

The Don's pet monster, Aps, attacks them, but they fight and defeat it.

**Tifa**  
It's too late...... Marlene... Barret... the people of the Slums.

**Aeris**  
Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?

**Tifa**  
.........Yeah...... you're right\! We still have time.

They make their way through the sewers, climbing out to find themselves in Sector 7's Train Graveyard.

**Cloud**  
Aeris. I got you mixed up in all of this...

**Aeris**  
Don't tell me to go home.

**Tifa**  
Let's see... If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here.

Winding their way through the abandoned trains, they make it to the all-but-deserted train station.

**Station man**  
I heard a rumor that the plate was going to fall, crushing this station, I've worked at so many years.  
But I just can't bear to leave here.

<span id="pillar"></span>They run on past the station to the gated base of the pillar. A small crowd is gathered by the fence, and gunfire sounds from the staircase adjacent to the pillar.

**Tifa**  
We made it\! The pillar's standing\!

**Cloud**  
Wait\! You hear something...... above us?

**Aeris**  
......gun fire?

The camera pans up the length of the pillar to where Barret is fighting at the very top of the stairs. Wedge is with him, but he falls from the platform to land near Cloud and the others. Everyone runs over.

**Cloud**  
Wedge\!\! You all right\!?

**Wedge**  
......Cloud...... You remembered...... my name.  
Barret's up top. ...help him......  
An' Cloud... Sorry, I wasn't any help.

Cloud shakes his head and stands.

**Cloud**  
I'm going up\!  
Aeris\! You look after Wedge.

**Tifa**  
Aeris, do me a favor.  
I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.  
There's a little girl named Marlene there......

**Aeris**  
Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.

Tifa turns to the crowd.

**Tifa**  
It's dangerous here\!  
Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly\!  
Everyone get out of Sector 7\!

Everyone disperses but no one leaves the area.

**Aeris** (crouching next to Wedge)  
Don't worry. You let me handle this.

**Soldier 2**  
L, look... This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute.

**Redhead**  
Umm... I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here with you.

**Shopkeeper**  
Uh oh...... There goes the pillar.  
I'm scared, but it's for your own good.  
If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll see happen too often.

**Man by Fence**  
Uhh...... Help\! My strange and wonderful little place.

**Soldier 1**  
Doh\! And this was supposed to be my last job\! Do something\!\!  
I never thought this would ever happen to me\! Great... I'm quitting tomorrow\!

If Cloud tries to leave the area...

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!\! You've gotta go now, or Barret's...

Cloud and Tifa climb the staircase, running into Biggs and Jessie, both wounded, along the way.

**Biggs**  
Cloud... so you don't care... what happens... to the... Planet?

**Cloud**  
\- Nope, not interested  
\- You're wounded......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope, not interested</span>

**Biggs**  
Hmph... you haven't changed. Oh, forget it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You're wounded......</span>

**Biggs**  
Thanks, Cloud.  
...don't worry 'bout me...... Barret's... fighting up there. Go help him...

</div>

**Jessie**  
...Cloud... I'm glad...... I could talk with you... one last time.

**Cloud**  
\- Don't say 'last'......  
\- Is that so...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't say 'last'......</span>

**Jessie**  
That's... all right...  
Because... of our actions... many...... people died...... this probably...... is our punishment...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Is that so...</span>

**Jessie**  
...Is... that so......?  
Ha...... cool...... as usual... ex-...SOLDIER. ...always... I liked that... in you...

</div>

Cloud and Tifa reach the top of the pillar to join Barret.

**Barret**  
Tifa\! Cloud\! You came\!  
Be careful\! They're attacking from the helicopter.

**Tifa**  
Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force\!  
Here they come\!

The helicopter passes overhead, and Barret fires at it. Reno jumps down and runs over to the control panel.

**Reno**  
You're too late. Once I push this button...

He pushes it.

That's all, folks\! Mission accomplished.

**Tifa**  
We have to disarm it\! Cloud\! Barret\! Please\!

**Reno**  
I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of Reno and the Turks...

They enter a battle with Reno, who casts his Pyramid spell on someone.

**Reno**  
Try and break it if you can.

The fight continues until Reno checks his watch.

**Reno**  
It's time.

Reno runs past Tifa and jumps from the platform. Tifa runs to the controls.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\! I don't know how to stop this. Try it\!

**Barret**  
DAMN\! It's a time bomb\!

**Cloud**  
...It's not a normal time bomb.

The helicopter rises up from below with Tseng of the Turks on its side rig and Aeris behind him.

**Tseng**  
That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.  
It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.

**Tifa**  
Please, stop it\!

**Tseng**  
Ha ha ha......  
Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.

**Barret**  
Shut yer hole\!

He fires at Tseng, who remains unfazed.

**Tseng**  
I wouldn't try that...... You just might make me injure our special guest.

Aeris lifts her head, and Barret lowers his gun arm.

**Tifa**  
Aeris\!\!

**Tseng**  
Oh, you know each other?  
How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me.

**Cloud**  
What are you gonna do with Aeris\!?

**Tseng**  
I haven't decided.  
Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.  
It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President.

**Aeris** (leaning forward)  
Tifa, don't worry\! She's all right\!

Tseng turns and slaps Aeris, and she falls back.

**Tifa**  
Aeris\!

**Aeris**  
Hurry and get out\!

**Tseng**  
Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?

The helicopter flies off just as the first explosions go off and the pillar starts to come apart.

**Tifa**  
Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry\!

They all spend a few moments frantically looking for an escape route, and then Barret jumps over to a cable attached to the platform.

**Barret**  
Yo, we can use this wire to get out\!

They all climb onto the cable and swing out as the plate comes crashing down behind them. The camera pans back to show President Shinra watching its destruction from his office as he listens to opera music.

---

<span id="playground"></span>Cloud, Tifa, and Barret land in the Sector 6 playground, now littered with smoking debris from Sector 7. They stand and walk slowly to the gate that once led to Sector 7.

**Barret**  
Marlene\! MARLENE\!\!  
MAR---LE---NE\!\!  
Biggs\!  
Wedge\!\!  
Jessie\!\!  
Goddamn it\!\!\!  
Dammit\!  
DAMMIT ALL TO HELL\!\!\!\!  
What the hell's it all for\!?  
ARGGHHHH\!\!\!

**Cloud**  
Hey, Barret\!

**Tifa**  
Barret\!

**Barret**  
ARGGHHHH\!\!\!

Cloud and Tifa run over to him.

**Cloud**  
Hey\!

**Tifa**  
Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret.

**Barret**  
URGHHHH\!\!\!

He fires several rounds at the rubble, then falls to his knees.

God damn...

Some time passes... Having settled down some, Barret is seated at the base of the slide, and Cloud and Tifa stand nearby.

**Barret**  
Marlene...

**Tifa**  
......... Barret......?  
Marlene is... I think Marlene is safe.

**Barret**  
......huh?

**Tifa**  
Right before they took Aeris, she said, "Don't worry, she's all right." She was probably talking about Marlene.

Barret gets to his feet.

**Barret**  
R, really\!?

**Tifa**  
But...

**Barret**  
Biggs...... Wedge... Jessie......

**Cloud**  
All three of them were in the pillar.

**Barret**  
Think I don't know that?  
But... we, all of us fought together.  
I don't wanna think of them as dead\!

**Tifa**  
...and the other people in Sector 7.

**Barret**  
This is all screwed up\!  
They destroyed an entire village just to get to us\! They killed so many people...

**Tifa**  
...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?

**Barret**  
No, Tifa\!  
That ain't it\! Hell no\!\!  
It ain't us\! It's the damn Shinra\! It's never been nobody but the Shinra\!

At this point, Cloud turns away and folds his arms pensively.

**Barret**  
They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to...  
build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold\!  
If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet\!  
Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them\!\!

**Tifa**  
.........I don't know.

**Barret**  
What don't you know\!? You don't believe me?

**Tifa**  
It's not that. I'm not sure about... me. My feelings.

**Barret**  
An' what about you?

**Cloud**  
.........

Cloud walks off towards Sector 5 without answering.

**Barret**  
Yo\!  
Where's he think he's goin'?

**Tifa**  
Oh\! Aeris\!

**Barret**  
Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?

**Tifa**  
...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene with.

**Barret**  
Damn\! Marlene\!\!

Barret starts after Cloud, but stops when Tifa doesn't follow immediately.

**Barret**  
Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now.

He turns and runs after Cloud. Tifa follows with a glance back over her shoulder. Up ahead, Cloud is making his way through Sector 6.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!

Cloud stops to let Tifa and Barret catch up.

**Barret**  
Take me to Marlene\!

**Tifa**  
You're going to help Aeris?

**Cloud**  
Yeah... But before that, there's something I want to know.

**Tifa**  
What's that?

**Cloud**  
...it's about the Ancients.

The screen goes black momentarily.

In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet\!

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth...?

He falls to one knee.

**Tifa**  
Are you all right?

**Barret**  
Pull it together, man\!

### Sector 5 - Aeris's Story

#### [Aeris's House: Elmyra Explains](#elmyra)

#### [Wall Market: A Golden Shiny Wire of Hope](#wallmarket)

---

Cloud and the others arrive in Sector 5.

**Person Outside the Pipe**  
Even with all that commotion, you went on like nothing happened. You must really been through the mill to get that.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Living in a place like this, you could live out several lives,  
and it still wouldn't be enough\!  
Well, how about some materia? Make some money and then scramble out of here\!

**Item Shopkeeper**  
...stare... ......hmph... we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.

**Woman Walking Around**  
Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.

Inside the nearby house...

**Man**  
The hell's up with that\!? I don't care if they're AVALANCHE or Avant-garde or whatever you call them. Anyone who brings the plates down on us is nuts\!\!

<div class="highlight">

This just in. An accident today...  
...the worst in the history of the metropolis. But thanks to the quick response by those in charge, there were no civilian casualties.  
The cause of the accident is unclear at this time, however, according to some sources it is believed to have something to do with the terrorist activities of the group, AVALANCHE.

</div>

Upstairs...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud took the kid's 5 gil earlier...</span>

**Kid**  
sniff......... sniff......... ......'n' I hid it...... so nuthin' like this...... would ever happen......... sniff......

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud left it alone...</span>

**Kid**  
My dream is to grow up and become a big time dealer on wall market.

</div>

Back outside...

**Kid from the Weapons Shop**  
...sniff... sniff...  
First there was a rumbling...... ...then cracking... and then ker-blaMM\!\!...  
...I was so scared... sniff...

**Person in Blue**  
You finally think you're making a living in the pits of Midgar, and then a big piece of scrap like that falls down here... what's next?

**Man in Straw Hat**  
Yeah, that's right\! But, even so, where could we move to now...?

Inside the Weapons Shop...

**Man**  
...sure is loud outside. Wonder what's happening?

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
You never know what's going to happen\! It's a crazy world,  
so you'd better at least have a weapon you can depend on\! Am I right or what?

<span id="elmyra"></span>They continue onward to Aeris's house, where Elmyra is there to receive them.

**Elmyra**  
Cloud...... wasn't it?  
It's about Aeris, isn't it?

**Cloud**  
...Sorry. The Shinra have her.

**Elmyra**  
I know. They took her from here.

**Cloud**  
They were here?

**Elmyra**  
That's what Aeris wanted...

**Cloud**  
Why is Shinra after Aeris?

**Elmyra**  
Aeris is an Ancient. The sole survivor.

**Barret**  
...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?

**Elmyra**  
...Not her real mother. Oh... it must have been 15 years ago...  
...during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.

<div class="highlight">

One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave.

In the flashback, Elmyra is waiting at the Sector 7 train station. A pair who look very much like Biggs and Jessie is hanging around at the lamp post like a couple. A man gets off the train and lifts the woman waiting for him into the air. Another man gets off, and the woman waiting for him picks him up. No one else gets off. Elmyra runs up to the station man who shakes his head.

My husband never came back.  
I wonder if something happened to him?  
No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled.  
I went to the station everyday.  
Then, one day.........

Aeris's mother Ifalna is lying at the bottom of the steps, and a seven-year-old Aeris stands nearby crying. Elmyra runs over. Ifalna slowly lifts her head, and then falls still again.

You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war.  
Her last words were, "Please take Aeris somewhere safe."  
My husband never came back. I had no child. I was probably lonely. So I decided to take her home with me.

As Elmyra continues, the scene changes to her house, with a young Aeris running around.

Aeris and I became close very quickly. That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything.  
She told me she escaped from some kind of research laboratory somewhere. And that her mother had already returned to the planet, so she wasn't lonely... and many other things.

</div>

**Barret**  
Returned to the planet?

**Elmyra**  
I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky,  
But she said it was this planet... She was a mysterious child in many ways.

<div class="highlight">

**Aeris**  
Mom.  
Please don't cry.

**Elmyra**  
Aeris just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened...

**Aeris**  
Someone dear to you has just died.  
His spirit was coming to see you, but he already returned to the planet.

**Elmyra**  
At that time I didn't believe her.  
But...

The scene shifts to show Elmyra sobbing at her kitchen table.

**Elmyra**  
Several days later... We received a notice saying my husband died...  
...and that's how it was.  
A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day...

In a new scene, Tseng of the Turks has come to the house. A young Aeris is hiding behind Elmyra.

**Tseng**  
We want you to return Aeris to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.

**Aeris**  
No\! Never\!

**Tseng**  
Aeris, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.  
Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.

**Elmyra**  
Of course I heard it. That she was an 'Ancient'.

**Tseng**  
The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.  
Aeris will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.  
That is why the Shinra would like Aeris's cooperation......

**Aeris**  
He's wrong\! I'm not an Ancient\! I'm not\!

**Tseng**  
But Aeris, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?

**Aeris**  
No, I don't\!

**Elmyra**  
But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers...  
She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed.

</div>

**Cloud**  
It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years...

**Elmyra**  
The Shinra needed her, So I guess they wouldn't harm her.

**Tifa**  
But why now......

**Elmyra**  
She brought a little girl here with her.  
On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough.  
She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.

**Cloud**  
Must be Marlene.

**Barret**  
Marlene\!\! Aeris was caught because of Marlene\!?  
I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm... really... sorry...

**Elmyra**  
You're her father\!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that\!?

**Barret**  
...please don't start with that. I think about it all the time. What would happen to Marlene, if I...  
But you gotta understand somethin'... ...I don't got an answer. I wanna be with Marlene... But I gotta fight.  
'Cause if I don't... the planet's gonna die.  
So I'm gonna keep fightin'\!  
But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene. I really just wanna be with her... always.  
See? I'm goin' in circles, now.

**Elmyra**  
...I think I understand what you're saying... She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her.

Barret goes upstairs.

**Tifa**  
It's my fault... I was the one who got Aeris involved in this.

**Elmyra**  
Don't say that. Aeris doesn't think that.

**Tifa**  
I feel so depressed.

**Elmyra**  
...sigh...

Upstairs, Barret is hugging Marlene to him.

**Barret**  
I'm so glad...... I'm so glad you're all right...

**Marlene**  
Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt\!

Cloud moves to leave without saying anything, but Barret notices him.

**Barret**  
Cloud\!  
You gonna go help Aeris, right? She's done so much for me...  
If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here\! I'm comin', too\!

**Marlene**  
Guess what? Guess what? Aeris was asking me lots of questions.  
Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud\!

**Cloud**  
\- I don't know  
\- Let's hope so

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I don't know</span>

**Marlene**  
Stupid\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let's hope so</span>

**Marlene**  
I won't tell Tifa\!

</div>

Cloud goes back downstairs and heads for the door.

**Tifa**  
You're going after Aeris, right?

**Cloud**  
Yeah.

**Tifa**  
I'm coming with you.

**Cloud**  
We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. ...You gotta be prepared for the worst.

**Tifa**  
I know.  
Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.  
If I stayed here... I'll go crazy.

Barret comes thundering down.

**Barret**  
Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?

**Elmyra**  
Yes, I don't mind.

**Barret**  
This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.

**Elmyra**  
...You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.

Barret turns to Cloud and Tifa. They all nod and run outside.

**Tifa**  
How do we get to the Shinra Building?

**Barret**  
There ain't no train that goes up there anymore...

**Tifa**  
......  
Well, let's just go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.

Back inside the house...

**Elmyra**  
I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.

**Marlene**  
Daddy, Tifa,  
Cloud\! Please bring Aeris back\!

<span id="wallmarket"></span>Cloud and the others head for Wall Market to search the area for something useful. Outside the Honey Bee Inn, the redheaded punk sits blocking the entrance...

**Punk**  
Hey\!\! It's you\!\!  
Sorry, but I already heard about you.  
In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things.  
We only let cultured customers in\! Got it? Then you'd better leave\!

**Guy Outside Inn**  
Hey, ya'll. Please stay here\!

**Kid by Cat Statue**  
It came down from the sky.  
But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some too.

**Punk**  
I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.

**Man Outside Restaurant**  
According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate.  
So, build your strength by having a plate of our food.

**Man Outside Dress Shop**  
That was scary...

**Clothing Shop Owner**  
You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it.

**Man Cooking Outside**  
Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over.

**Person 1**  
Is this pile of trash getting bigger?

**Person 2**  
Yes, I think so.  
A lot of things came falling down when the Sector 7 pillar fell.

**Person 1**  
Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff that came falling down.

**Person 2**  
Oh is that why? He seems pretty suspicious these days.

**Person 1**  
Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?

**Person 2**  
Oh, you know\! I wonder what he's doing?

**Person 1**  
Yeah\! It gives me the chills.

Inside the gym...

**Beautiful Bro**  
So? How's it?

**Man Using Punching Bag**  
More strength.  
I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe.  
Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.

In the bar...

**Redhead**  
Scary, isn't it? You just never know when the plate might come crashing down.

**Redhead 2**  
Yeah. I'd like to climb up to the plate if I could.

In the Weapons Shop...

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
You goin' up to the plate? You better have a Battery.

**Cloud**  
You're gonna sell me something you just found?

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
Hey, you knew? But I repaired it, so it's all right.

**Cloud**  
Why do I need a battery to climb up to the plate?

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 Gil for each?

**Cloud**  
......  
\- All right, I'll take them  
\- I think you're full of it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">All right, I'll take them</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Batteries"\!

</div>

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
Come again.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you don't have enough money...</span>

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
Hmm, looks like you're a little short, son. Come back again.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I think you're full of it</span>

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
All right then, go see for yourself. You'll be back again.

</div>

As they approach Don Corneo's mansion, a trio of kids runs into the alley beyond.

**Kid**  
Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me\!

Corneo's mansion is empty, except for Kotch strapped to a table in the basement.

**Kotch**  
Hey\! You're... not them... you're...  
Please, help me\!

**Cloud**  
\- Help him  
\- Leave him

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Help him</span>

**Kotch**  
Thanks\!  
You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying things like 'information leaked' and 'good for nothing'.  
They took Don somewhere and that's it...... I'm still here.  
Oops\! They're here again... I'm outta here\! SEE ya

He runs off.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Leave him</span>

**Kotch**  
I... I was just following the Don's orders\! Help me\!

</div>

In the alley beyond the mansion, they find a girl standing at the bottom of a graffitied wall.

**Girl**  
Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary...... Brrr.

**Tifa**  
Can we climb it?

**Girl**  
Yeah. It leads to the Upper World.

**Barret**  
Awright\! We'll climb this wire\!

**Cloud**  
There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?

**Barret**  
There IS a way\! Look\! What's that look like?

**Cloud**  
Just a normal wire.

**Barret**  
Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.

They all look up.

**Tifa**  
You're right. This is the only way to save Aeris...

**Cloud**  
Ok, that was a bad analogy, but, Barret, I understand how you feel.  
Let's go\!

Cloud and the others start up the wire. At the top of the wall, the other two kids are looking at the rubble of Sector 7.

**Kid 2**  
Oh man\! This is horrible...

**Kid**  
Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.

Cloud climbs past them to where the wire ends and there is a tangle of piping and train tracks.

**Cloud**  
Maybe if I put a battery in...  
The propeller might work.

If you didn't buy a battery and had to come back, on the second time he will say, "It might work if I put a battery in it."

I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.

Cloud puts a battery in and the propeller spins, ending in a different position and opening up a path. He continues on up.

Need a battery here, too.  
Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar.  
Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use OK button to jump)

If he misses it he'll say either "Jumped too soon..." or "Jumped too late..."

Making their way through the tangle of debris left by Sector 7's destruction, Cloud and the others eventually reach the upper plate...

<span id="arrival"></span>Cloud, Tifa, and Barret stand before Shinra Headquarters.

**Barret**  
Hey, you oughta know this building well.

**Cloud**  
...Not really, now that I think about it,  
This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters.

**Barret**  
I heard about this place before.  
Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees.  
Must be where they took Aeris.  
The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go\!\!

**Tifa**  
Wait a second\! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?

**Barret**  
Well what else does it look like\!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......

**Tifa**  
That's not going to work\! We've got to find another way...

**Barret**  
Ain't gonna be no other way\! If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll...

**Tifa**  
I know that\! But if we get caught here...  
Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?

**Cloud**  
\- Let's bust on in\!  
\- Let's sneak in quietly

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let's bust on in\!</span>

**Barret**  
That's more like it\! C'mon, let's go\!\!

They run inside.

**Receptionist**  
Excuse me\! If you don't have an appointment, you'll just have to...

**Barret**  
Don't need no appointment... This is a 'mergency\!  
Anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta the way\!\!

He aims his gun-arm at the receptionist.

**Receptionist**  
Yaagghh\!

**Soldiers**  
Who do they think they are?  
Y, You don't think that's AVALANCHE?  
Intruders\! Seize them\!\!

Everyone else flees as the soldiers run to fight Cloud and the others, who defeat them with ease.

**Barret**  
Let's go to the top\!

If Cloud checks the elevator tubes near the front entrance...

**Cloud**  
Nothing. Have to find another way up, I guess...

At the back of the lobby, there is a bulletin board there with flyers.

**Bulletin**  
Shinra, Inc. This week's phrase  
Shinra's Future Is The World's Future\!\!  
Mako Energy For A Brighter World\!\!

**Flyer**  
Turtle's Paradise Newsletter No. 2  
The end of another hard day. Wouldn't you like to sit back with a tall cool one?  
You can at the Turtles Paradise\!\! Stop in today\!  
There's nothing like a smooth one after work\!

On the second floor is a shop, and a couple is looking at a car advertisement on a television screen.

**Woman**  
Honey...... Buy me that car\!

**Man**  
But baby, that's way too expensive.

**Woman**  
What did you say?

They notice Cloud and the others.

**Man + Woman**  
.........

They flee.

Hh, hey\!  
Ww, wait for meeeeeeee............\!

**Shopkeeper**  
Welcome. Today we have on special...  
Eagghhh\!\!  
Here, t, take the money...

**Barret**  
Don't want no money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals.  
We jes want back what your boss stole from us.

**Shopkeeper**  
A, AVALANCHE?

**Barret**  
Now we ain't gonna hurt you. Might even pay ya, if ya help us.

**Shopkeeper**  
Ok... ok... well...  
Thank you and come again... Forget I said that...

On speaking to her again...

**Shopkeeper**  
What is it?

If they try to open the treasure chests...

**Shopkeeper**  
You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait\!

Cloud and the others leave and get on an elevator.

**Tifa**  
......What's wrong?

**Cloud**  
I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved Aeris.  
I should have known that was impossible though...

**Barret**  
Heh, heh, heh.

**Cloud**  
What is it? You're givin' me the willies.

**Barret**  
So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.

**Cloud**  
Who cares if you're impressed...?

**Barret**  
Y'know, I ain't so good at sayin' this, but... Sorry... for lotsa things.

A red light starts flashing and alarms go off.

**Barret**  
Wh, what the\!?

**Tifa**  
Look\!

The numbers on the elevator are all scrambling.

**Barret**  
DA-MN...\!  
I don't care where, Cloud\! Just stop it\!

**Tifa**  
What's going on\!?

The elevator stops four times before finally reaching the 59th floor. On some of the floors, instead of fighting Shinra soldiers, a Shinra employee may attempt to get on the elevator.

**Shinra Employee**  
Oh man\!\!  
No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on.  
Oh man\!\!

\[[on to the 59th floor](#59)\]

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let's sneak in quietly</span>

**Tifa**  
See? Let's be careful and find a different route\!

They enter through a side entrance and start climbing the stairs.

**Barret**  
Yo\! You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?

**Tifa**  
Well, we've got to get to Aeris to help her somehow.

**Barret**  
Talk about out of the way...

**Tifa**  
I don't have time to argue with you. I'm going\!

**Barret**  
Y, yo, Tifa\! Don't go off by yourself...

If Cloud turns around to leave the stairwell, the others come running back after him.

**Tifa**  
Wait a minute, Cloud\!

Barret and Cloud follow Tifa up the stairs.

**Barret**  
Don't know... Why... the hell... We gotta... climb...

**Cloud**  
...Because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved Aeris.  
I doubt that's possible though...

**Barret**  
...heh heh heh.

**Cloud**  
Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.

**Barret**  
So even you will fight for someone else. I had you figured wrong I guess.

**Cloud**  
Who cares what you figured\!

**Barret**  
I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong...

**Tifa**  
heh heh heh......

**Cloud**  
What's that supposed to mean, Tifa?

**Barret**  
...how much farther do these stairs go on?

**Tifa**  
Why don't you ask them?

**Barret**  
It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', d'ya think?

**Tifa**  
Of course not\!\!

**Barret**  
Right... couldn't be that...  
Are we there yet?

**Tifa**  
Not yet.

**Barret**  
...there yet?

**Tifa**  
I said not yet\!

**Barret**  
Yo...

**Tifa**  
Look, don't even ask\! We're way way way way far away from being there yet, ok\!?

Finally Barret stops, panting.

**Barret**  
Damn, man\! I've had it\! I'm going back\!

**Tifa**  
And take just as long going down as you did coming up?

**Barret**  
............

**Tifa**  
C'mon, Barret. Pull it together\!

**Barret**  
Yeah, well all I know is I'm just flesh 'n' blood... 'cept for this arm of mine.  
Don't treat me like I'm some ex-member of SOLDIER or somethin'......

**Tifa**  
What about me\!? I'm human too\! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on\!

She turns to continue up the stairs, then stops.

......?

She pulls her skirt down.

Yaah\! Barret\! You go first\!

**Barret**  
What're ya ignorant? I didn't mean that...

**Tifa**  
All right, all right\!  
Cloud, you go on ahead too\!\!

They continue on...

**Barret**  
Yo... What floor is this?

**Tifa**  
...I gave up counting.

**Barret**  
Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?  
That Shinra... They're just no damn good.

**Tifa**  
.........

**Barret**  
huff... Man, I'm beat...  
Marlene, Daddy wanted to see your face one more time...

**Tifa**  
Would you stop acting like a retard and climb\!?  
It's just a bit more\!  
...maybe.

They finally reach the top and stop, panting.

**Barret**  
F...finally... M... made it...  
N... never wanna see... no more stairs the rest of my life...

**Tifa**  
huff... puff... this really takes it out of you...  
But this is it. We'd better get ready...\!

They all walk through the exit to the 59th floor.

</div>

<span id="59"></span>If Cloud tries to go back down...

**Barret**  
Hey Cloud\!  
You come all this way, you thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- No......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Barret**  
We ain't got no time for that\! Stop messin' around, boy\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No......</span>

**Barret**  
Yeah, that's right\! Let's go on then\!

</div>

Some soldiers are standing by the next set of elevators.

**Soldiers**  
Destroy the intruders\!

Cloud and the others fight off the soldiers, one of whom drops something.

**Cloud**  
What's this?

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Keycard 60"\!

</div>

They take the elevator up to the 60th floor.

**Tifa**  
I hope Aeris is all right.

**Barret**  
This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.

<span id="60"></span>The Shinra employee meant to be watching the security cameras is asleep on duty, so he doesn't see Cloud as he steps out of the elevator onto the 60th floor. A series of bust statues and a pair of guards block the way to the stairwell up.

**Guard**  
What're you doing here\!? No unauthorized people are allowed here\!\!

**Guard 2**  
People like you don't belong here\! Go on, get out\!

They proceed into a side room.

**Barret**  
Lookit that, all them guards is runnin' around.  
Cloud, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to come.  
When those guards turn around, MOVE\!

**Tifa**  
Stay in the shadows\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud messes up...</span>

**Guard**  
Hey there\! What do you think you're doing there\!?

Cloud and the others fight off the guards.

**Barret**  
What the hell're ya doin'? Come on gotta do it again\!

If Cloud messes up four times they end up taking out all the guards.

**Barret**  
I shoulda known it'd turn out like this...  
If I'd known it'd be like this in the first place...

**Tifa**  
Shhh\! Now let's move on.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they make it past the guards successfully...</span>

**Barret**  
Ok\! We gonna rock\!

**Tifa**  
Remember, we're here to save Aeris.

**Barret**  
Hell, I know that\!

</div>

<span id="61"></span>They continue on to the 61st floor, the door to which is stuck open so they can get through without a keycard. It is a lounge area with a huge tree in the center and a number of employees milling around.

**Woman**  
I don't remember seeing your face before... You new here?  
Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some... things.

**Cloud**  
\- Things?  
\- Um, I'm kinda in a hurry...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Things?</span>

**Woman**  
Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach you how to get to the next floor.  
The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th floor. But you can't get there without a keycard.  
Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely.

Ding.

...voila\! You hear that sound and the door opens.  
Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard alone won't let you go everywhere.  
For example,  
'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. 'Keycard 65' only takes you to the 65th floor.  
It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, all the power in Midgar and the world, for that matter, is controlled by them.  
Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Um, I'm kinda in a hurry...</span>

**Woman**  
Oh? That's too bad...

</div>

**Man**  
This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for the big wigs in the company.  
It's tough working under someone. Tires you out.

**Man 2**  
What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?  
Even employees can't walk around above the 60th floor without a keycard.

**Man 3**  
The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?

**Cloud**  
\- Where's Aeris?  
\- ......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where's Aeris?</span>

**Man 3**  
Aeris? How did you know that name? You must be...\!?  
Aeris, you mean that kid. The receptionist. Yeah, I was startin' to worry 'bout her myself.  
And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?  
You mean, she's not? It's someone else?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">......</span>

**Man 3**  
Oh, I see. So you must be that whatcha call it...  
Shinra, Inc. Repair Division\!\!  
You know, it looks like this building is starting to fall apart.  
This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right away.  
Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors too. I'll give you this.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received Key Item "Keycard 62"\!

</div>

**Man 3**  
This door is stuck wide open. Better fix this right away.

</div>

**Woman Sitting Down**  
I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know what that was all about?

**Man Sitting Down**  
No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th floor is safe.

<span id="62"></span>Having obtained the next keycard, they continue on to the 62nd floor, which houses several different libraries. They find a man waiting outside someone's office.

**Hart**  
How do you do?  
This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office.  
I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me...

**Domino**  
Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?  
You all must be those... ahem... Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of Midgar.  
Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc.  
My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents...  
Me\! The Mayor\! A librarian\! Ohh......  
You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard.  
Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard\!  
Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item\!

**Hart**  
Did you speak with the Mayor?  
What? A password? Oh, I get it...  
He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.  
Maybe I can help you.  
What do you want to know?

**Cloud**  
\- HELP  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">HELP</span>

**Hart**  
Sure, sure. All right.  
As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.  
So here's a hint...  
...for 500 gil.

**Cloud**  
\- Give him the money  
\- Forget it\!

**Hart**  
Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.  
Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc. ...  
Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries.  
Pay careful attention to the files in each room.  
The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.  
What can I do for you?

**Cloud**  
\- Give me the hint again  
\- Give me the next hint  
\- Uh, nothing

**Hart**  
Sure, sure. All right.  
As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people. So here's a hint...  
...for 1000 gil.

**Cloud**  
\- Give him the money  
\- Forget it\!

**Hart**  
Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.  
Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library.  
Look carefully at the numbers on each file.  
What can I do for you?

**Cloud**  
\- Give me the hint again  
\- Give me the next hint  
\- Uh, nothing

**Hart**  
Sure, sure. All right.  
As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.  
So here's a hint...  
...for 2000 gil.

**Cloud**  
\- Give him the money  
\- Forget it\!

**Hart**  
Oh, my... well, Thank you very much.  
There is a number at the beginning of each file name.  
Of course there's a number even on the files that don't belong in that library.  
Match the number with the letters in the title of the file.  
If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and... well, you get the idea.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you don't have enough money...</span>

**Hart**  
Hey now\! You're a bit short.  
I'm sure even item stores in the slums don't give credit nowadays.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

**Hart**  
...I see. Then, I guess that's that.  
Good luck finding it on your own.  
If you still can't find it. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime...

The placement of the books and the numbers vary each time, but below are the titles in their correct libraries without numbers. In each library there is also a television screen displaying a notice.

After obtaining the password, Cloud returns to Domino's office.

**Domino**  
Got it?  
Then tell me.  
So, what's the password?

**Cloud**  
\- BEST  
\- KING  
\- ORBS  
\- BOMB  
\- MAKO  
\- HOJO  
\- Wait a second

<div class="block">

<div class="highlight-nopad">

If Cloud guesses it right the first time, Domino will say any of the following depending on the password. (ORBS and HOJO are never the password.)

</div>

**Domino**  
BEST\!\!  
God, I love the sound of that\! BEST\!\! I AM the best... ME\!\! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.

KING\!\!  
God, I love the sound of that\! KING\!\! President Shinra sucks\! I should be King of Midgar\!

BOMB\!\!  
God, I love the sound of that\! BOMB\!\! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode\!

MAKO\!\!  
God, I love the sound of that\! MAKO\! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor\!

**Domino**  
......hmm. Well, ok. Here, take it.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Keycard 65"\!

**Domino**

Fine then, take this.

If Cloud guesses wrong the second time, too, Domino doesn't give him anything extra whenever he finally gets it right.

</div>

</div>

</div>

**Domino**  
Why would I do something like this, you ask?  
To mess with them, of course\! Shinra's been torturing me forever.  
That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer.  
This ought to make us even\! Heh heh heh......  
But my card will only get you to the 65th floor.  
Can you believe how they treat me? ...ME\! Like some common employee...

**Hart**  
If you run into President Shinra please don't tell him about this.  
I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.

<span id="63"></span>Having obtained Domino's keycard, Cloud and the others continue on to the 63rd floor, which is a maze of small storage rooms with locked doors. Near the escalators is a room with a computer.

An air-duct... It doesn't look like I'll be able to climb in here.

The ducts can, however, be reached from some of the other rooms. By using the air ducts and the three doors, Cloud can manage to get all three coupons and return to the computer.

<span id="64"></span>Cloud and the others move on to the 64th floor. Here, they find an exercise room, a nap room, and a locker room.

**Receptionist**  
You must be a visitor. Please feel free to use any unused machines.

**Man Lifting Weights**  
Hmph, hmph... Since I'm head of security for this building, stamina's very important to me.

**Woman on Treadmill**  
...huff... puff... If you're tired, you should get some rest in the next room.

**Man on Treadmill**  
...huff... weeze... I'm starting to worry about my belly......

If Cloud approaches a free treadmill...

**Cloud**  
.......  
\- Should I try it?  
\- This is so stupid

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Should I try it?</span>

Cloud hops on the treadmill. After a while...

**Cloud**  
Whew...  
\- Better quit pretty soon  
\- Continue a bit longer

If Cloud chooses to continue 3 times, he will then hop off on his own.

**Cloud**  
Feels like I got a little lighter...... At least I think so...

**Man in Nap Room**  
...zzz... Please...... let me...... get some... rest......

**Sign in Bathroom**  
Out of Order  
Please use a different Floor  
Shinra Company Repair Management Department

In the locker room, some of the lockers are unlocked.

**Cloud**  
What is this...... a Megaphone?  
Hanging on to this won't do any good...

<span id="65"></span>They move on to the 65th floor, where there is a model of Midgar in a central room, and treasure chests placed around in side rooms.

**Cloud**  
A model of Midgar... born from Mako sucked right out of the earth.  
Parts of the model are missing...  
\- Place the Midgar parts  
\- Leave it alone

**Cloud**  
...Sounds like something opened up...

Placing all the parts in the model opens up the treasure chest with Keycard 66 in it.

<span id="66"></span>Cloud and the others move on to the 66th floor, which is dominated by a large conference room. Several offices and a bathroom take up the remaining space.

**Secretary**  
Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files...  
But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of being a secretary\!

If Cloud speaks to her after she enters one of the offices, she will say any of the following depending on the room:

**Secretary**  
Hello...\!\! (He's kinda cute. But looks like that girl's with him... But that's kinda exciting\!)  
Hello...\!\! (Just concentrate on work...)  
Hello...\!\! (Looks so serious. I guess it means the man's fastidious.)  
Hello...\!\! (Wow, Pee-U\! No thanks.)

**Man**  
Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some sort of stench coming from somewhere...

**Man 2**  
........................  
........................  
........................  
........................  
........................  
........................  
Phew\!

**Man 3**  
Hey, when you're in the bathroom, do you ever hear whispers coming from somewhere?

**Man 4**  
They're having another executive meeting. I wonder if it's about that Plate incident.

**Man 5**  
It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands.

**Woman**  
Come on, we're building the future of Mako\!

Cloud enters a stall in the bathroom. Above it is a vent.

**Cloud**  
\- Flush?  
\- Climb up?  
\- Get out of here

Cloud climbs up and enters the duct system. Together he, Barret, and Tifa peer down through the next vent at the conference room below, where Shinra's executives are having a meeting.

**Barret**  
Geez--\! That's a lotta suits\!

**Reeve**  
We have the damage estimates for Sector 7.  
Considering those factories we already set up and all the investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil...  
The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is...

**President Shinra**  
We're not rebuilding.

**Reeve**  
What?

**President Shinra**  
We're leaving Sector 7 as it is.  
And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.

**Reeve**  
...then the Ancients?

**President Shinra**  
The Promised Land will soon be ours.  
I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.

**Palmer**  
Rate hike\! Rate hike\! Tra, la, la\! And please include our Space Program in the budget\!

**President Shinra**  
Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate increase.

**Palmer**  
Oh man\!

**Reeve**  
Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence...

**President Shinra**  
It'll be all right.  
The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more.

**Heidegger**  
Ha ha ha\!  
After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE\!

**Barret**  
That dirty \#$\*$^

**President Shinra**  
Hojo. How's the girl?

**Hojo**  
As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18%.

**President Shinra**  
How long will the research take?

**Hojo**  
Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.  
That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.

**President Shinra**  
What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?

**Hojo**  
That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has her weaknesses.

He starts giggling.

**President Shinra**  
That concludes our meeting.

They all get up and head for the door. Scarlet pauses to look up.

**Scarlet**  
Something stinks...

She, too, walks out.

**Cloud**  
They were talking about Aeris... right?

**Barret**  
I dunno.

**Tifa**  
Probably.

**Cloud**  
Let's follow 'em.

They climb back out of the ventilation shaft and into the bathroom. Hojo has fallen behind the others in leaving the conference room, and they follow him at a distance. They stop to wait for him to reach the top of the escalator before entering the stairwell after him.

**Cloud**  
Hojo... huh...?

**Man 4** (after the meeting)  
Sittin' here facing the monitor... day in, day out... I kinda feel...... forced... into doing it. And I just don't have any motivation.

<span id="67"></span>They follow Hojo up before the door can lock after him, thereby reaching the 67th floor. Here sprawls the lower level of Hojo's laboratory. The three pause by the escalator.

**Barret**  
I remember him.  
That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. Cloud, don't you know him?

**Cloud**  
This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So... that's what he looks like...

They continue on.

**Man**  
Let's see... The specimen Hojo asked me for is...

Cloud and the others head down the hall and enter the lab, in the center of which is a glass chamber holding a lion-like creature. Someone is coming, so they hide behind some crates.

**Man**  
Is this today's specimen?

**Hojo**  
Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.

The man walks away, and Hojo leans forward to touch the glass.

**Hojo**  
My precious specimen...

He turns and leaves. Tifa walks up to the glass.

**Tifa**  
Precious specimen...?  
Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?

Cloud suddenly takes notice of a chamber to his right, and looks through the window.

**Cloud**  
Jenova...

He clutches his head in pain and collapses. Tifa runs over as he gets up.

**Cloud**  
Jenova... Sephiroth's... So... they've brought it here.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, be strong\!

**Cloud**  
Did you see it?

**Barret**  
See what?

**Cloud**  
It's moving...... still alive?

Barret looks inside.

**Barret**  
Where's its $\#&\*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.

They go upstairs to find Hojo standing before a corresponding glass chamber directly above the other, inside of which is Aeris.

**Cloud**  
Aeris\!

**Hojo**  
Aeris? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?

**Cloud**  
We're taking Aeris back.

**Hojo**  
Outsiders......

**Barret**  
Shoulda noticed it earlier, you...

**Hojo**  
There's so many frivolous things in this world.

Barret runs over and aims his gun-arm at Hojo.

**Hojo**  
Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.  
The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?

**Cloud**  
Ugh.

**Hojo**  
That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.  
Now, bring in the Specimen\!

The elevator within the glass chamber raises, bringing the lion-creature up to join Aeris. It starts growling at her and she runs away to pound on the glass.

**Aeris**  
Cloud, help\!

**Cloud**  
What do you think you're doin'?

**Hojo**  
Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them are on the brink of extinction...  
If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.

**Tifa**  
...animal? That's terrible\! Aeris is a human being\!

**Barret**  
You're gonna pay\!

**Cloud**  
Barret\! Can't you do anything?

**Barret**  
Awright\!\! Step back\!

**Hojo**  
Stop\!\!

Barret fires at the glass chamber, and it starts glowing brightly. Hojo rushes to the door.

**Hojo**  
Wh... what are you do-- Oh\! My precious specimens...

The door opens and the lion-creature jumps out, pouncing on Hojo.

**Cloud**  
Now's our chance to get Aeris\!

He runs inside the chamber.

**Aeris**  
Thanks, Cloud.

She runs out. Cloud starts to follow, but stops and turns around.

**Tifa**  
Cloud... what's wrong?

**Cloud**  
...The elevator is moving.

**Hojo**  
This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen\!

The lion creature looks up from attacking Hojo to address them.

**Red**  
He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.

**Tifa**  
It talked\!?

**Red**  
I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss.

**Cloud**  
We'll take care of that monster.  
Somebody take Aeris somewhere safe...  
\- Tifa, I'm countin' on you\!  
\- Barret, take care of her\!

Aeris runs out with either Tifa or Barret.

**Cloud**  
What's your name?

**Red**  
Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish.

**Cloud**  
Come on\!

They dispatch Hojo's specimen, and Aeris rejoins the group.

**Cloud**  
Aeris, you all right?

**Tifa**  
She seems all right, ...in many ways.

**Red XIII**  
I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things.

**Barret**  
What are you?

**Red XIII**  
An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see.  
...You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way.

**Aeris**  
Cloud... so you did come for me.

**Red XIII**  
I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard......

**Barret**  
Now we've saved Aeris, ain't no need to be in this buildin'\! So let's get the hell outta here\!

**Cloud**  
If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up into two groups.

Whoever he doesn't choose to come with him says goodbye:

> **Barret**  
> Later\! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> I'll see you later\!\! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
>
> **Tifa**  
> We'll be going first\! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor\!

The other team leaves.

**Man**  
No\! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do.  
To prove it to you... here, this is the key card to the 68th Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Keycard 68"\!

</div>

The man then flees.

If Cloud attempts to go anywhere but the elevator...

> **Barret**  
> Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
>
> **Aeris**  
> Not that way\! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.

Cloud and the others get on the 66th floor elevator. Rude of the Turks enters behind them.

**Cloud**  
H, hey\! What is it?

**Rude**  
Would you press 'Up' please?

**Cloud**  
Turks? Must be a trap...

Rude steps aside and Tseng enters.

**Tseng**  
It must have been a real thrill for you... Did you enjoy it?

**Cloud**  
Ggh...

<span id="captive"></span>The Turks take them up to the 70th floor, where they find the others also taken captive. Aeris is missing, though.

**Cloud**  
You all got caught, too?  
Where is Aeris\!?

**President Shinra**  
In a safe place.  
She's the last surviving Ancient...  
Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history.

**Red XIII**  
Cetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?

**President Shinra**  
Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised Land.' I'm expecting a lot out of her.

**Red XIII**  
The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?

**President Shinra**  
Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue.  
It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile.  
...If the land is fertile...

**Barret**  
Then there's gotta be Mako\!

**President Shinra**  
Exactly. That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is necessary.  
The abundant Mako will just come out on its own.  
That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory...

**Barret**  
@$\#\*^%\! Quit dreamin'\!

**President Shinra**  
Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power.  
Well, that is all for our meeting.

**Rude**  
Come on\! Outta his way\!

Cloud, Tifa, and Red XIII turn away without protest, but Barret hangs back.

**Barret**  
Hold it\! I got a lot I wanna say to you\!

He starts towards President Shinra, but Rude drags him away.

**President Shinra**  
If you need something else... talk to my secretary.

The scene changes to the detainment area, where they've been placed in cells. Cloud with Tifa, Barret with Red XIII, and Aeris by herself.

**Tifa**  
Psst (Can we get out?)

**Cloud**  
\- (Leave it to me)  
\- (Kinda hard)

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">(Leave it to me)</span>

**Tifa**  
Psst (Cloud, you're so brave\!)

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">(Kinda hard)</span>

**Tifa**  
Psst (Don't give up\!)

</div>

**Cloud**  
I wonder how Barret is doing

**Barret**  
Hey\!  
Aeris is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.  
The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.  
I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.  
Is that right?  
The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.  
Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy.  
...and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.  
I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members\!\!  
Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too.

He turns to Red XIII.

How 'bout you?

Red XIII turns away and lies down.

**Barret**  
You're so damn boring.

**Cloud**  
I wonder how Red XIII is doing

**Red XIII**  
............Grandpa.

**Barret**  
Grandpa\!? Ha, ha, ha...... Grandpa, hmm...... ha, ha, ha......

**Red XIII**  
What's so funny?

**Barret**  
Nothin'...... ha, ha

**Cloud**  
I wonder how Aeris is doing

**Aeris**  
Cloud, are you there?

**Cloud**  
Aeris\!? You safe?

**Aeris**  
Yeah, I'm all right.  
I knew that Cloud would come for me.

**Cloud**  
Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?

**Aeris**  
The deal was for one date, right?

Tifa sits up from where she's been lying on the cot.

**Tifa**  
............oh, I get it.

**Aeris**  
...\!? Tifa\! Tifa, you're there too\!

**Tifa**  
EXCUSE me.  
You know, Aeris. I have a question.

**Aeris**  
What?

**Tifa**  
Does the Promised Land really exist?

**Aeris**  
...I don't know.  
All I know is...  
The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.  
And...... then...  
The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.

**Tifa**  
...What does that mean?

**Aeris**  
More than words...... I don't know.

**Cloud**  
...Speak with the Planet?

**Tifa**  
Just what does the Planet say?

**Aeris**  
It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.

**Cloud**  
You hear it now?

**Aeris**  
I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is... my real mother.  
Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land.  
...That's what mom said.  
I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but...

**Cloud**  
Let's just get some sleep

<span id="blood"></span>They settle down to rest. Cloud wakes before the others, finding the door to his and Tifa's cell open.

**Tifa**  
......

**Cloud**  
The door's open... When did it open?

He runs out into the hall to find the guard dead.

What's happened?

He runs back into the cell.

Tifa... Wake up\!

She sits up immediately.

**Tifa**  
What's wrong?

**Cloud**  
Something's wrong. Look outside.

Tifa runs out, and Cloud joins her.

**Tifa**  
I wonder what happened...

**Cloud**  
He should have the key on him...  
Come on, Tifa, get Aeris. I'll go help Barret and the others.

Cloud runs into Barret and Red XIII's cell.

Barret, Red XIII... come with me. Something's wrong.

**Barret**  
How'd you get in? Why's the door open\!?

Barret and Red XIII run out.

**Tifa**  
This's kinda eerie...

**Aeris**  
Must've been attacked by...

**Barret**  
The hell's goin' on'\!?

**Red XIII**  
No human could've done this.  
I'll go on ahead.

**Barret**  
I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra\!

**Tifa**  
Come on, let's follow Red XIII\!

Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa follow Red XIII to where the Jenova specimen was kept, finding a huge bloody hole in the front of the empty chamber, with a trail of blood across the floor.

**Cloud**  
...Did it get away? Jenova...?

**Red XIII**  
Jenova Specimen... Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.

Red XIII heads for the elevator and the others follow.

**Red XIII**  
It looks like it leads up...

They follow the trail of blood to the 70th floor, where they find President Shinra dead at his desk, impaled by the Masamune blade.

**Barret**  
He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead...

Tifa runs around behind the desk.

**Tifa**  
Then this sword must be...\!?

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth's\!\!

**Tifa**  
...Sephiroth is alive?

**Cloud**  
...Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.

**Barret**  
Who cares who did it\!? This is the end of the Shinra now\!

**Palmer**  
Uh\!

He comes out from behind a pillar and tries to run, but Cloud and Barret catch him.

P, p, p, please, don't kill me\!

**Cloud**  
What happened?

**Palmer**  
Se... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.

**Cloud**  
Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?

**Palmer**  
Yeah, I saw him\! I saw him with my own eyes\!

**Cloud**  
You really saw him?

**Palmer**  
Uh\! Would I lie to you at a time like this\!? And I heard his voice too\!  
Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land.

**Tifa**  
Then what?  
Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?

**Barret**  
So he's a good guy then?

**Cloud**  
Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way\!\!  
It's not that simple\! I know him\! Sephiroth's mission is different\!

Palmer frees himself and runs off as a helicopter arrives outside.

**Barret**  
Rufus\! &\*%$\! I forgot about him\!

**Tifa**  
Who's that?

**Barret**  
Vice President Rufus. The President's son.  
I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time...

**Aeris**  
I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.

**Red XIII**  
I only know his name.

**Tifa**  
I wonder what kinda person he is...

They run outside to where Rufus and Palmer are, Palmer apparently just finishing up a quick report.

**Rufus**  
So... So Sephiroth was actually here. ...By the way.

Palmer runs off.

**Rufus**  
Who are you guys?

**Cloud**  
I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class\!

**Barret**  
I'm from AVALANCHE\!

**Tifa**  
Same here\!

**Aeris**  
...a flower girl from the slums.

**Red XIII** (growling)  
...a research specimen.

**Rufus**  
What a crew.  
Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.

**Barret**  
You only President, 'cause yer old man died\!

**Rufus**  
That's right. I'll let you hear my new appointment speech.  
...Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to have been working.  
The population thought that Shinra would protect them.  
Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra army will help you.  
It looks perfect on the outside.  
But, I do things differently.  
I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man.  
A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste money on them.

**Tifa**  
He likes to make speeches just like his father.

<span id="escape"></span>Cloud turns to Barret.

**Cloud**  
Get outta this building with Aeris\!

**Barret**  
What?

**Cloud**  
I'll explain later\! Barret\! This is the real crisis for the Planet\!

**Barret**  
The hell's that supposed to mean?

**Cloud**  
I'll tell you later\! Just take my word for it now\! I'll go after I take care of him\!

**Barret**  
Awright, Cloud\!

Barret and the others run back downstairs. Aeris hangs back.

**Aeris**  
Cloud... I just thought of something.

**Tifa**  
...I'll wait for Cloud\! Everyone, get to the elevator\!

Aeris nods, and she, Red XIII, and Barret run on.

**Aeris**  
Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should check on our equipment.

They get on the elevator, and a combat robot attacks them from the other car. They defeat the robot and continue down.

Back to Cloud, as he and Rufus face off...

**Rufus**  
Why do you want to fight me?

**Cloud**  
You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth.

**Rufus**  
Hm, exactly.  
Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?

**Cloud**  
...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land\!

**Rufus**  
I see. I guess this means we won't become friends.

Cloud fights Rufus and his pet Dark Nation.

**Rufus**  
Heh, heh, heh...

Ultimately, Rufus decides to beat a dignified retreat.

**Rufus**  
Heh... That's all for today...

Rufus grabs hold of the helicopter and it flies off with him. Cloud runs downstairs to where Tifa is waiting.

**Tifa**  
Where's Rufus?

**Cloud**  
I couldn't finish 'em. Looks like this's gonna get complicated.

Back to Aeris and the others as they arrive on the first floor. If you attempt to get back on any of the elevators (depending on the floor):

**Aeris**  
Quickly\! We'll escape out this way......  
Quickly, we can escape this way...  
Quickly, we have to get out of here...

They head for the front entrance.

**Barret**  
I'll go on ahead\!

He runs out, firing his gun-arm, but soon comes back in.

\*&^%(\*... surrounded, huh?  
If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but, I gotta reputation to protect.

**Aeris**  
You all get out while you can.  
It's not you they're after... it's me.

**Barret**  
Yeah, well that ain't happenin'.  
You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to watch out for you\!  
Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses...

**Aeris**  
...thank you, Mr. Barret\!

**Barret**  
Who you callin' Mr. Barret? That don't sound right\!

**Red XIII**  
Well then...  
If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way to get out of here.

**Barret**  
Huh? Oh, oh yeah... You a cold man. Just like someone else 'round here I know.

**Red XIII**  
Did you say something?

**Barret**  
Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?

**Tifa**  
Barret\!\!

Tifa comes running down from upstairs.

**Barret**  
Tifa\! Where's Cloud?

**Tifa**  
Everyone, over here\!

**Barret**  
Huh? What's up? Where's Cloud?

**Tifa**  
I'll tell you later\! Hurry, Hurry\!\!

They all climb into the display truck and drive it out the window, following Cloud on the motorcycle. Shinra troops follow on motorcycles, but Cloud dispatches them with his sword. They reach the end of the road, and a large, armored tank/robot attacks from behind. They defeat the robot, and find themselves standing at the edge of Midgar.

**Barret**  
Well, what do we do now?

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth is alive. I... I have to settle the score.

**Barret**  
And that'll save the Planet?

**Cloud**  
...Seems like it.

**Barret**  
Awright, I'm going\!

**Aeris**  
I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out.

**Cloud**  
About the Ancients?

**Aeris**  
......Many things.

**Tifa**  
I guess this's good bye, Midgar.

They climb down a cable to the ground level.

**Red XIII**  
I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.

**Tifa**  
...I guess this is the start of our journey...

**Cloud**  
\- You hate traveling?  
\- It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You hate traveling?</span>

**Tifa**  
...I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?</span>

**Tifa**  
......Mmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise.

</div>

**Aeris**  
You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar...

**Cloud**  
\- Really? ...You worried?  
\- It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Really? ...You worried?</span>

**Aeris**  
A little, ...no, maybe a lot. But I have my bodyguard, right?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?</span>

**Aeris**  
I thought you'd say that\!

</div>

**Barret**  
We told Aeris's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe too.

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, she should be  
\- Hmm, I don't know

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, she should be</span>

**Aeris**  
She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. ...Maybe it's for the best.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Hmm, I don't know</span>

**Aeris**  
Stop it, Cloud\! I'm worried too.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Then...  
\- Let's stay here for a while  
\- Let's go\!

**Barret**  
We need a group leader for our journey. 'Course only me could be the leader.

**Tifa**  
You think so...?

**Aeris**  
It would have to be Cloud.

**Barret**  
^\#$^%...... awright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.  
'Sides, we can't have 5 people strolling down the fields. It's too dangerous. Split us into 2 parties...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud chooses Aeris + Tifa for his party...</span>

**Barret**  
...Thought you'd do that.  
Later, at Kalm\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud chooses Barret + Red XIII for his party...</span>

**Aeris**  
...Unexpected

**Tifa**  
...combination.  
Well, have fun with just the guys.  
We'll see you at Kalm\!

</div>

They otherwise depart without comment.

It is possible to go as far as the entrance of the Mythril Mines before entering Kalm. After viewing the Midgar Zolom, Cloud will dismount, pause, and turn to his chocobo.

**Cloud**  
...I got the feeling I'm forgetting something...  
Hey, would you stay there just a minute?

Not far inside the mine, the others stop.

> **Barret**  
> Hey Cloud. If we keep going, we'll never get to Kalm.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hey, Cloud. Wasn't Kalm right before this cavern?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> ...We won't get to Kalm even if we go through these caverns.

> Yo, wassup? Can't SOLDIER-man even lead the way?

> **Aeris**

>
> **Tifa**  
> Kalm should be closer to Midgar.
>
> **Red XIII**  
> If we're planning to meet at Kalm, we should go back and look for it again.

Cloud and his party arrive in Kalm.

> **Barret**  
> This is Kalm.
>
> **Aeris**  
> We've reached Kalm.
>
> **Tifa**  
> So this is Kalm?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> ......looks like we've reached Kalm.

> **Barret**  
> Yo, I'll be waitin' at the inn... Hurry up and get your butt over there\!

> **Aeris**  
> I wonder if everyone's there already. Let's hurry over to the inn\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Everyone's waiting at the inn. Let's go Cloud.

> **Red XIII**  
> We're supposed to meet at the inn. ......Shall we go?

The party starts to enter the inn.

> **Barret**

> **Aeris**  
> Well then, I'll go on ahead.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Let's go Cloud.

> **Red XIII**  
> Let's go Cloud.

<span id="explore"></span>The others all go inside, but Cloud has the opportunity to explore the town before joining them. A number of people are out in the square.

**Redhead**  
Aw, c'mon\! listen to me\! Got anything interesting to say?......

**Old Man**  
Thanks to Shinra, Inc. developing Mako energy for us, everything's more convenient now.  
Maybe a little too convenient.

**Black-haired Man**  
Tourists, huh?  
There are some things you should know that'll come in handy when you travel around the world......  
Want me to tell you what they are?

**Cloud**  
\- Tell me  
\- I already know

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tell me</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
Then let me explain how to use the world map.  
Well then, what do you want to know?

**Cloud**  
\- Changing the camera angle  
\- Map indicators  
\- Operating the buttons

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Changing the camera angle</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
First of all, press the \[L2 button\] on the controller to change the camera angle.  
There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like.  
You can then rotate the angles either way by pressing the \[L1 button\] and \[R1 button\].  
Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It makes the journey a lot more fun\!  
Anything else you'd like to know?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Map indicators</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
Press the \[Start button\] once to view the World Map.  
There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which, and you won't get lost as much.  
Push the \[Start button\] twice to change the size of the map, and once more to turn it off.  
Pretty easy, huh?  
Anything else you want to ask?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Operating the buttons</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
You can ride things by pressing the \[SELECT button\] and get off by pressing the \[cancel button\]. This isn't so hard, either\!  
Oh, yes, yes. You can't dash with the World Map on, so make sure not to press the \[cancel button\] unless you get off.  
Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get off them, so be careful.  
Anything else you want to ask?

</div>

**Black-haired Man**  
Once on the World Map you can access the menu to save your game anywhere. It's a good idea to save frequently\!  
Well then, bon voyage\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I already know</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
Is that so? Well, that's that. Have a nice trip.

</div>

**Man in Blue**  
I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being sucked dry.  
We're better off with them bringing in the Mako energy.

Or, if you talk to him when he stops to read the gauge outside the Weapons Shop:

What does it do? It checks the pressure of the Mako energy sent from Midgar.

**Man**  
I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new president, was badly hurt.  
Hey, I bet that's news to you?

**Cloud**  
\- Hey you're pretty clued\!\!  
\- Don't care...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Hey you're pretty clued\!\!</span>

**Man**  
Heh, heh, heh...... This is just between us. I heard it was that there Ava-whaddya call-ums that attacked the President Shinra and his son.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't care...</span>

**Man**  
Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on what Shinra's doing.

</div>

**Man**  
Shinra is leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are just gonna sit back and take it?

**Woman**  
The famous floating city, Midgar... Just once I'd love to see it in person.  
South of this town past the Mythril Mine and far to the west is a Shinra harbor called Junon.  
They say there's a reactor and many tall buildings there. I hope to see it someday.

Inside the first house...

**Woman**  
Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to Shinra.  
Don't you think?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, maybe  
\- You're full of it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, maybe</span>

**Woman**  
See\!? How would we get by without Mako energy?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">You're full of it</span>

**Woman**  
Hmmn. But I'd hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako energy.

</div>

**Woman**  
Yeah, Mako energy's made our lives much easier. And it's all thanks to Shinra, Inc.

**Girl Upstairs**  
Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient......  
But seems like a lot of plants and animals have been disappearing at a rapid pace.  
I think the old life was better.  
Don't you think so?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, maybe  
\- No way

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, maybe</span>

**Girl Upstairs**  
Yeah, sure I'm right\! You think so, don't you?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No way</span>

**Girl Upstairs**  
That sounds just like what my mom says.

</div>

**Girl Upstairs**  
I thought things were better when I was able to play with animals......

Inside the second house...

**Old Man**  
Did you say you came from Midgar?  
I used to live there, too. But I hear they got lots of troubles lately.

Inside the third house...

**Woman**  
There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak\! He was carrying a wicked-looking sword.  
Why doesn't anyone believe me? I'm all alone...

Upstairs, a boy is running around while a little girl watches him.

**Girl**  
......My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke\!

**Boy**  
When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training hard now\!\!  
Hyah, hayah, eagghh\!

Inside the fourth house...

**Woman**  
Is it true that Shinra made a Monster?

**Cloud**  
\- It's true  
\- Just a rumor

**Woman** (she says the same thing regardless)  
Yeah, well either way, as long as we're using the reactor, we can't stand up to Shinra.

**Kalm Traveler**  
The world's at peace... all's well.  
I got my health, and enough to eat... all's well.

**Kid outside Bar**  
My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mine.  
Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar...

Inside the bar...

**Person in Blue**  
I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor...  
There sure have been a lot of dangerous accidents recently. I hate it, just hate it.

**Man**  
Me? I used to work in a coal mine down south called Mythril Mine  
But, right around then, monsters started appearing.  
After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here drinking.  
Urrrp\! ...hic... I'm stinking drunk\!\!

**Bartender**  
It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around, but I guess they finally got wiped out by SOLDIER.  
Shinra is trying to eliminate anyone, who stands up to them.  
It don't matter if we like it or not. Shinra's taken over, and we gotta live with it\!

**Cook**  
Stay out of the kitchen.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
This is the Item Store.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
This is the Materia Store.

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
This is the Weapons Store.

If Cloud tries to leave Kalm...

**Cloud**  
Barret and the others are waiting for us at the inn.

His exploration of the town exhausted, Cloud goes to the inn.

**Innkeeper**  
Mr...... Cloud? Your party is waiting for you on the 2nd floor.

<span id="beginning"></span>Cloud heads upstairs to find everyone waiting.

**Aeris**  
Cloud, you're late\!

**Barret**  
Yo man, you're late\!

**Cloud**  
Sorry to keep you waiting.

**Aeris**  
Guess everyone's here now.

**Barret**  
So let's hear your story......  
You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet.  
Let's hear it all.

**Cloud**  
......I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.  
After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends.

**Barret**  
You call that a friend?

**Cloud**  
Yeah, well......  
He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself.

**Tifa**  
.........

**Cloud**  
So I guess you'd call him a war buddy...... We trusted each other. Until one day......

**Aeris**  
...one day?

**Cloud**  
After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.  
......that was 5 years ago.  
I was 16......

<div class="highlight">

A flashback sequence begins. Cloud and Sephiroth are riding in the back of a truck with two Shinra infantrymen.

**Cloud**  
It sure is raining hard.

He walks to one of the infantrymen.

Hey, how are you doing?

**Soldier**  
I'm all right.

**Cloud**  
I wouldn't know...  
I've never had motion sickness.

He walks to the other infantrymen.

Everything okay?

**Sephiroth**  
Hey.  
Settle down.

**Cloud** (doing squats)  
They gave me some new Materia.  
I can't wait to use it.

**Sephiroth**  
...just like a kid.

**Cloud**  
You going to brief us about this mission?

**Sephiroth**  
...this isn't a typical mission.

**Cloud**  
Good\!

**Sephiroth**  
Why do you say that?

**Cloud**  
I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you.  
But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.  
My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.  
That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.  
Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?

**Sephiroth**  
...I thought you wanted a briefing?

Cloud scratches his head.

**Sephiroth**  
Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.  
There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.  
First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.

**Cloud**  
Brutal creatures... Where?

**Sephiroth**  
The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.

**Cloud**  
Nibelheim...  
That's where I'm from.

**Sephiroth**  
Hmm... hometown...

There is a loud thud.

**Driver**  
Sir... s, something strange just crashed into our truck\!

Sephiroth stands.

**Sephiroth**  
That would be our Monster...

Sephiroth and Cloud go outside to fight the green dragon that attacked the truck. Sephiroth kills it in a few hits.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth's strength is unreal. He is far stronger in reality than any story you might have heard about him.

**Aeris**  
So... Where do you come in?

**Cloud**  
Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.

**Tifa**  
.........

**Cloud**  
......and then we reached Nibelheim.

<div class="highlight">

<span id="arrival"></span>

Another flashback sequence opens: Sephiroth approaches the gate to Nibelheim, then turns around to face the others, who are still off-screen behind him.

**Sephiroth**  
How does it feel?  
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?  
So how does it feel?  
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...

**Cloud**  
Ummm... how 'bout your parents?

**Sephiroth**  
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...

He laughs and shakes his head.

What does it matter...?  
All right, let's go.

The others approach and stop before the gate.

**Soldier**  
Psst... (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)

**Soldier 2**  
It's so boring, being on watch.

**Cloud**  
\- You want to do what we always do?  
\- Just sit tight, it's your job, right?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">You want to do what we always do?</span>

Shall we practice?

**Soldier 2**  
Practice... oh, you mean practice my pose.  
Does someone in SOLDIER always have to be careful about what other people think?  
...How did it go?

He strikes a pose.

...Was it like this?

While they're talking, the other soldier perks up and strikes the same pose.

**Cloud**  
Good job\!

**Soldier 2**  
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Just sit tight, it's your job, right?</span>

I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.

</div>

**Sephiroth**  
The Mako smell is pretty bad here.

</div>

**Barret**  
You wait a minute\!\!  
Isn't that, um...?  
The name of Sephiroth's mother...  
I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.

**Cloud**  
That's right.

**Tifa**  
Barret, would you please let us hear what Cloud has to say? You can ask questions later.

**Barret**  
Tifa, I was only......

**Tifa**  
Okay Cloud, continue.

**Aeris**  
It's a reunion of childhood pals\!

**Cloud**  
......I was really surprised with Tifa.

<div class="highlight">

<span id="nibelheim"></span>

**Cloud** (narrating)  
...The town was quiet.  
Everyone must be staying in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters.  
No, maybe they're afraid of us...

In the flashback sequence, Sephiroth and Cloud are standing just outside the inn.

**Sephiroth**  
We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.

He heads for the door, then stops and turns back.

All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.

One of the soldiers runs in from the gate, stopping just behind Cloud.

**Sephiroth**  
Oh, that's right...  
You may visit your family and friends.

Sephiroth goes inside just as a man runs out of the neighboring house.

**Man with Camera**  
I heard Sephiroth was coming and got my camera ready.  
I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.

**Cloud**  
\- Take my picture.  
\- Better get back in the house, it's dangerous.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Take my picture.</span>

**Man with Camera**  
I don't take pictures with nobodys.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Better get back in the house, it's dangerous.</span>

**Man with Camera**  
All right... So big-headed...  
Hey? This guy's a real...  
You... Are you Cloud?  
Really? So that's how it is, huh?  
Gosh, Cloud, you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad.

**Cloud**  
\- Then take my picture  
\- It's dangerous, get back in your house

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Then take my picture</span>

**Man with camera**  
Let's do this, Cloud. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">It's dangerous, get back in your house</span>

**Man with Camera**  
OK, OK,...... So big-headed... You're just his assistant

</div>

</div>

**Soldier**  
Man... I'm so nervous.

**Cloud**  
\- How come?  
\- I'm excited.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">How come?</span>

**Soldier**  
Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">I'm excited.</span>

**Soldier**  
...That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero...

</div>

Inside the house next to the inn...

**Woman**  
Welcome.  
Hey? Aren't you...

Flash of white. The woman disappears.

**Cloud**  
...Have I come here before?  
...I don't remember.

**Barret**  
Now you're pissin' me off\!\! This don't matter, so get on with it\!

Once Cloud emerges, the soldier is now walking around the square, pausing to look at the water tower, Tifa's house, and Cloud's house. Cloud walks up to the Shinra mansion.

**Cloud**  
This Mansion...  
...No, I'll come here later.

Tifa's father is standing near the mansion.

**Tifa's Father**  
Hmm? You from Shinra?

**Cloud**  
\- That's right\!  
\- Who are you?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">That's right\!</span>

**Tifa's Father**  
Geez... Big-headed young kid.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Who are you?</span>

**Tifa's Father**  
I'm the town's... ...... ......\!?  
Aren't you Cloud?  
Don't you know me?

**Cloud**  
You're Tifa's...

**Tifa's Father**  
Right. I'm Tifa's father.  
...I want you to stay away from my daughter.  
We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town\!

</div>

If Cloud tries to go up the path towards the mountain...

**Cloud**  
Up ahead is... Mt. Nibel.  
I'll tell you about the time I went into the mountains.

Cloud goes to his house across the street.

**Cloud**  
This is...... my house. It has nothing to do with that incident five years ago.

</div>

**Barret**  
Yo wait, I wanna hear.

**Aeris**  
Me too\! It's been a long time, right?

**Barret**  
Tell us more\!  
You saw your family, right?

**Cloud**  
\- Don't want to talk about it  
\- All right......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't want to talk about it</span>

**Barret**  
Well I ain't gonna force ya...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">All right......</span>

I don't know if you could call it a 'family'......  
My father... died when I was still very young.  
That's why my mom...... was living alone in this house.  
Yeah, I saw my mom.  
My mom... she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all.  
But a few days later, she died...  
But when I saw her, she looked fine.

</div>

<div class="highlight">

Back in the flashback, Cloud walks farther into his house.

**Cloud**  
Uh...?

**Cloud's Mom**  
Ye----s?

She runs over.

Cloud\!?  
Welcome home, Cloud\!

**Cloud**  
Hi, mom.

Flash of white noise.

**Cloud's Mom**  
Come, come... Let me take a look at you\!  
Hmmm......  
You look so handsome.  
So this is a SOLDIER uniform?

**Cloud**  
......Mom, I...

Flash. Cloud is now lying on the bed.

**Cloud's Mom**  
My, how you've grown.  
I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.

**Cloud**  
...Not really.

**Cloud's Mom**  
...I'm worried about you.  
There are a lot of temptations in the city...  
I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend.

**Cloud**  
...I'm all right.

**Cloud's Mom**  
You should have...  
an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.  
I think that would be the perfect type for you.

**Cloud**  
......I'm not interested.

Flash. They're now standing in the kitchen.

**Cloud's Mom**  
Are you eating right?

**Cloud**  
I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.

**Cloud's Mom**  
Is that so?  
You can't cook, right?  
I was worried sick about how you were doing...

Flash.

**Cloud's Mom**  
Cloud...?

Flash.

**Cloud's Mom**  
You know, Cloud......

Flash.

**Cloud's Mom**  
......isn't that right, Cloud?

Flash.

**Cloud's Mom**  
I will always be your mother...

The screen fades to black.

**Cloud** (narrating)  
......Let's stop this......

The image returns, with Cloud just outside his house. If he tries to go back inside...

**Cloud**  
Hey...  
I can't... remember much else. There's... nothing more to talk about.

**Aeris**  
That's all right, Cloud.

Cloud goes into Tifa's house.

**Tifa**  
Cloud...?  
Did you go into my house?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah...  
\- No...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Yeah...</span>

I thought you might be home.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">No...</span>

I remember you weren't there.

</div>

Cloud walks up to Tifa's room.

**Tifa**  
Cloud...?  
Did you go into my room?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah......  
\- No...

He walks to her piano.

**Tifa**  
Did you play my piano?

**Cloud**  
\- No, I didn't  
\- Yeah, I jammed on it  
\- Just a little

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">No, I didn't</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Yeah, I jammed on it</span>

...Now how did this go?  
\- I forgot  
\- I remember

Cloud plays on the piano a bit. If you play the FF7 main theme, he'll say:

I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Just a little</span>

I can read sheet music too, you know...... Ummm, let's see......  
Do... Re... Mi... Ti... La... Do... Re... Mi... So... Fa.. Do.. Re... Do... Forget...

</div>

Cloud walks to Tifa's desk.

**Cloud**  
The letter...

**Tifa**  
Did you read it? My letter?

**Cloud**  
\- I'd never do that\!  
\- Yeah...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">I'd never do that\!</span>

**Tifa**  
Of course\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Yeah...</span>

**Tifa**  
Do you remember what it said...?

**Cloud**  
\- I don't remember...  
\- I remember clearly

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">I don't remember...</span>

**Tifa**  
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">I remember clearly</span>

**Cloud**  
I read it...  
It was a letter addressed to Tifa from the son of the guy that runs the General Store...

**Letter**  
Tifa, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.  
Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was Cloud.  
But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.  
Well, enough about him.  
Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything... so out of it.  
Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.  
Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money.  
...but, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first. That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.  
I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.  
I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.

**Tifa**  
Cloud... Do you remember all of it?

**Cloud**  
\- No, that's it  
\- Yeah, I remember it all

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">No, that's it</span>

**Tifa**  
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Yeah, I remember it all</span>

Because there was some stuff about me...

**Letter**  
I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.  
Hey, Tifa... Is that stupid old water tower still working?  
Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?  
And most of all, how are you, Tifa? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.  
We were all talking about you last night.  
Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.  
I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.  
Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter\!  
So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.  
P.S. Write me back, okay?

</div>

</div>

</div>

Cloud walks to the dresser.

<span class="highlight-white">Received "Orthopedic Underwear\!"</span>

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!\!\!

**Cloud**  
\- It's true  
\- Just kidding. Don't get mad...

**Tifa** (she says the same thing regardless)  
...Cloud  
We're talking about something really important here.

Inside the neighboring house...

**Black-haired Woman**  
...Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.  
Oh, I'm sorry\! It's you, Cloud\! I didn't recognize you.

Two kids come running in.

**Girl**  
Shinra----?

**Boy**  
Chinra---?

**Girl**  
SOLDIER?

**Boy**  
Saltza?

**Girl**  
Are you going to kill the monsters?

**Boy**  
......are you going to?

**Girl**  
He's soooo cool\!\!

**Boy**  
Way cool\!\!

**Black-haired Woman**  
Cloud, you've grown to be a strong man.

**Boy**  
........................

**Girl**  
Do your best.

**Boy**  
Do your best.

Cloud enters the inn.

**Gramps**  
So, what do you need, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- Where's Sephiroth?  
\- Give me a room to stay.  
\- Let me know the situation of the town.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Where's Sephiroth?</span>

**Gramps**  
Yeah, he's upstairs.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Give me a room to stay.</span>

**Gramps**  
It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Let me know the situation of the town.</span>

**Gramps**  
Now about the town...  
A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.  
Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.  
It was all right when they were building the reactor.  
...while they were still building it.  
But once it was completed, it's been bad.  
Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.  
I don't know if the reactor was good or bad...  
I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But now, what can you do about it...?  
Anyhow we've got to get rid of the monsters...  
Then, we'll all be able to relax a little bit.

</div>

**Zangan**  
......Hmmmm  
Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?

**Cloud**  
And who are you?

**Zangan**  
I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.  
I have 128 students all over the world\!  
In this town, a girl named Tifa is my student.

**Cloud**  
Did you say Tifa?

**Zangan**  
Tifa has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.  
I want to see some Shinra techniques.  
And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.  
Well, good luck.

If you go back outside to talk to the soldier again...

**Soldier**  
Hey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation...

Cloud goes to the second floor of the inn to find Sephiroth standing by a window, staring out. While they're talking, the infantryman from the square comes up the stairs and enters the room.

**Cloud**  
What are you looking at?

**Sephiroth**  
...This scenery...... I feel like I know this place.

**Soldier** (inside the room)  
We're short one bed...

**Sephiroth**  
.........  
...We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.

**Cloud**  
\- It's still early  
\- Yeah, let's get some sleep.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">It's still early</span>

**Sephiroth**  
...I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Yeah, let's get some sleep.</span>

**Sephiroth**  
I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.  
I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her...

</div>

<span id="mtnibel"></span>The next day, Cloud wakes late and runs out to join Sephiroth and the two soldiers at the start of the mountain path, just past the mansion. A few of the townsfolk are hanging around, too.

If Cloud goes back to the inn instead...

**Gramps**  
So, what do you need, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- Where's Sephiroth?  
\- Give me a room to stay.  
\- Let me know the situation of the town.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Where's Sephiroth?</span>

**Gramps**  
...I think you probably know better than I do, but...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Let me know the situation of the town.</span>

**Gramps**  
It's the same story I always tell. You still want to hear it?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, tell me again  
\- No, that's all right

</div>

Inside the house next to the inn...

**Woman**  
Welcome.  
Oh, oh, you're...

Flash of white. The woman disappears. The same dialogue from earlier repeats and Cloud is standing back outside.

Inside the house next to Tifa's...

**Black-haired Woman**  
Have a safe trip.

If you try to enter the mansion...

**Sephiroth**  
Hey, stay over here\!

**Man with Camera**  
Think they'd let me take a picture?

**Tifa's Father**  
If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits...

**Soldier**  
I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep...

**Soldier 2**  
...Late again.

If you try to go past them up the mountain path...

**Sephiroth**  
Hey, calm down\! Wait over here.

**Sephiroth**  
Once the guide gets here, we're heading out.

**Tifa's Father**  
Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens...

Tifa comes running up while he's speaking.

**Sephiroth**  
...Trust me.

**Tifa**  
I'll be all right, Dad\!  
I have two men from SOLDIER with me.  
I'm Tifa. Nice to meet you\!

**Cloud**  
Tifa\! You're the guide?

**Tifa**  
That's right.  
I just happen to be the number one guide in this town.

**Cloud**  
It's too dangerous\! I can't involve you in something like this\!

**Sephiroth**  
Then there's no problem if you protect her.  
...Let's go.

**Man with Camera**  
Ummm...  
Mr. Sephiroth\! Please let me take one picture for a memento\!  
Tifa, can you ask him for me too......?

Cloud and Tifa both pose in front of the mansion. Sephiroth reluctantly walks over.

**Man with Camera**  
Cheeeeese\!

He snaps a picture, and Sephiroth walks away immediately after.

**Man with Camera**  
Great, thank you\!  
I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed\!

They start out up the path to Mt. Nibel...

**Cloud** (narrating)  
A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel.  
The cold air of the mountains of Nibel. It was no different...

If Cloud runs back to town instead of following Tifa...

**Tifa's Father**  
I hate myself for asking you this, but...  
Don't take your eyes off of Tifa\! Hurry up and go back to her side\!

**Gramps**  
Hey, you want to rest?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes, please  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Yes, please</span>

**Gramps**  
It's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Forget it</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

**Zangan**  
Oh? Did you come crying home?

Up on Mount Nibel, Cloud follows Tifa onto a rickety-looking rope bridge.

**Tifa**  
It gets harder from here\! Follow me\!

**Soldier**  
Let's hurry.

Cloud and the soldiers start across after her.

**Tifa**  
Uh... the bridge\!\!

The bridge creaks and then snaps, and they all fall to the rocks below. Cloud and Tifa land near each other and get up. Sephiroth and one of the soldiers come around the bend to join them.

**Sephiroth**  
Everyone seems to be all right. Can we get back to where we were?

**Tifa**  
These caves are intertwined, just like an ant farm...  
Oh, and Sephiroth... There seems to be one person missing...

**Sephiroth**  
It may sound cold, but we've got no time to search for him. We can't go back now, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.

They continue on, entering some multi-colored caves.

**Cloud**  
What's this?

**Tifa**  
A mysteriously colored cave...

**Sephiroth**  
It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.

Coming out of the caves into the light, they find a Mako fountain.

**Cloud**  
...And what's this?

**Sephiroth**  
A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.

**Tifa**  
It's so beautiful...

She walks up to it.

If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too...

The others walk over to join her.

**Sephiroth**  
Materia. When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced.  
It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state.

**Cloud**  
By the way... Why is it that when you use materia you can also use magic too?

**Sephiroth**  
You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?  
...the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the materia.  
Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the Land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the planet calling up magic...... or so they say.

**Cloud**  
Magic...... a mysterious power...

**Sephiroth**  
Ha, ha, ha\!

**Cloud**  
Did I say somethin' funny?

**Sephiroth**  
A man once told me never to use an unscientific term such as mysterious power\! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'\!  
I still remember how angry he was.

**Cloud**  
Who was that?

**Sephiroth**  
Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist.  
He was a walking mass of complexes.

**Tifa**  
A Mako fountain... So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.

<span id="reactor"></span>They continue on and reach the Mako Reactor.

**Tifa**  
We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.

**Cloud**  
Tifa, you wait here.

**Tifa**  
I'm going inside too\! I wanna see\!

Cloud shakes his head.

**Sephiroth**  
Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.

**Tifa**  
But\!

Sephiroth turns to the soldier.

**Sephiroth**  
Take care of the lady.

The soldier nods and moves to block Tifa's way up the stairs as Cloud and Sephiroth go on inside.

**Tifa**  
Mm, man\!  
Better take real good care of me then\!

Beyond the initial entry over the Mako pit, there is a large chamber. Inside are a number of strange pods, and at the top of some stairs there is a door marked Jenova. Sephiroth is standing before it, shaking his head. Cloud joins him.

**Cloud**  
This is...... Jenova, right? The lock won't open...

Sephiroth goes down the stairs and Cloud follows.

**Sephiroth**  
This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken.  
Cloud, close the valve.  
Did you close the valve?

Cloud closes the valve.

**Sephiroth**  
Why did it break...?

He pulls himself up to look in the window of one of the pods.

...now I see, Hojo.  
But, even doing this, will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast.  
This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy... that is, when it's working correctly.  
Now... what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?

**Cloud**  
Uh, umm...... Oh yeah\! It becomes a Materia.

**Sephiroth**  
Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. ...Take a look.  
Look through the window.

Cloud pulls himself up to look. Upon seeing the monster inside, he falls back.

**Cloud**  
Wh... what is this\!?

**Sephiroth**  
Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako.  
You're different from the others, but still human.  
But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you.

Cloud gets to his feet.

**Cloud**  
...is this some kind of monster?

**Sephiroth**  
Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters.  
Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are.

**Cloud**  
Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?

Sephiroth clutches his head as though in pain.

**Cloud**  
H... hey, Sephiroth\!

**Sephiroth**  
N... no......  
...Was I?

He starts slashing at the pods with the Masamune, and Cloud leaps back.

**Sephiroth**  
...Was I created this way too?  
Am I the same as all these monsters......

**Cloud**  
...Sephiroth.

**Sephiroth**  
You saw it\! All of them... were humans...

**Cloud**  
Human\!? No way\!

**Sephiroth**  
...I've always felt since I was small...  
That I was different from the others. Special, in some way.  
But... not like this...

He twists to look as one of the monsters suddenly bursts out of its pod and lies moaning. The scene fades.

**Cloud** (narrating)  
Am I...... human?  
I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time.  
I was even more surprised by the fact that Shinra was producing monsters.

</div>

**Barret**  
Damn, Shinra\! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em\!

**Tifa**  
......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that.

**Red XIII**  
That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.  
I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so Barret?

**Barret**  
(Why you talkin' to me\!?)

**Cloud**  
\- Save game and take a rest  
\- Keep talking

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Save game and take a rest</span>

**Barret**  
Yeah, mebbe so. Wanna take a breather here?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Keep talking</span>

Nothing special happens.

</div>

**Barret**  
......I get it.

**Aeris**  
Tifa... You were waiting outside then?

**Tifa**  
......Yes.

**Cloud**  
We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself at the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.

**Tifa**  
Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?

**Cloud**  
We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.

**Tifa**  
The villagers used to call it Shinra mansion.

**Cloud**  
Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion...

<div class="highlight">

Flashback scene: Cloud and the soldier join Zangan, Tifa, Tifa's father, and the man with the camera at the gate to the Shinra mansion. Cloud looks around at all of them, nods, and proceeds to the mansion. He can turn back to talk to them, but they bar his path into the rest of the village.

**Man with Camera**  
What's Sephiroth doing?

**Zangan**  
There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?

**Cloud**  
\- Why...?  
\- No way\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">Why...?</span>

...Why do you ask?

**Zangan**  
The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be an embarrassment to the company...  
You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight-white">No way\!</span>

It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.

**Zangan**  
...Oh my. You sure do have faith.

</div>

**Tifa's Father**  
Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.

Cloud goes inside on his own and finds the soldier outside one of the bedrooms.

**Soldier**  
There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room...

Cloud goes into the room and finds the hidden door that leads down into the basement. At the end of the hall is a library, where he finds Sephiroth pacing while he reads.

**Sephiroth**  
...an organism that was apparently dead, was found in a 2000 year old geological stratum.  
Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova...  
X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient...  
X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use...

Sephiroth stops in the hallway and lowers the book, looking up.

My mother's name is Jenova... Jenova Project... Is this just a coincidence?  
Professor Gast... Why didn't you tell me anything? ...Why did you die?

Cloud approaches him.

**Sephiroth**  
Let me be alone.

Cloud leaves the library.

**Cloud** (narrating)  
Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion...  
He continued to read as if he were possessed by something, and not once, did the light in the basement go out......

<span id="snap"></span>Cloud wakes in another bedroom of the Shinra mansion. He walks across the mansion to the basement entrance.

**Soldier**  
Sephiroth seems different.

Cloud goes down to the basement and down the hall to the library.

**Sephiroth**  
Ha, ha, ha......

Cloud continues to the study in the back, where he finds Sephiroth seated behind the desk.

**Sephiroth**  
Who is it\!?  
Hmph... traitor.

**Cloud**  
Traitor?

Sephiroth stands.

**Sephiroth**  
You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you.  
This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on...  
At the end of their harsh, hard journey, they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness.  
But, those that disliked the journey appeared. Those who stopped their migrations built shelters and elected to lead an easier life.  
They took that which the Cetra and the planet had made without giving back one whit in return\!  
Those are your ancestors.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth...

**Sephiroth**  
Long ago, disaster struck this planet.  
Your ancestors escaped... They survived because they hid.  
The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to increase.  
Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports.

**Cloud**  
What does that have to do with you?

**Sephiroth**  
Don't you get it?  
An Ancient named Jenova was found in the geological stratum of 2000 years ago.  
The Jenova Project.  
The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients...... no, the Cetra.  
...I am the one that was produced.

**Cloud**  
Pr... produced\!?

**Sephiroth**  
Yes.  
Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me.

**Cloud**  
How... how did he...?  
Se... Sephiroth?

**Sephiroth**  
Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother.

Sephiroth leaves the library. Cloud runs out of the mansion after him, only to find the village below in flames. Trying to walk through the flames to the north will trigger a voice.

He---y\! Is anyone here?

Cloud starts into the village.

**Zangan**  
Hey it's you\! You're still sane, right?

Cloud nods.

**Zangan**  
Then come over here and help me\!  
I'll check this house. You check that one over there\!

He runs into the general store.

**Man with Camera** (lying on ground)  
...Hey,  
Ummm... Am I going to die?

**Soldier** (lying near Cloud's house)  
...Sephi... roth

Cloud runs into his house, but comes out again right after, shaking his head.

**Cloud**  
Terrible...  
Sephiroth... This is too terrible...

Cloud turns to see Sephiroth cutting down villagers with the Masamune. Sephiroth turns and walks away through the flames. Cloud runs after him. He arrives at the Mako reactor to find Tifa kneeling by her father's body. The Masamune lies nearby.

**Tifa**  
Papa...  
Sephiroth\!?  
Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he\!?  
Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything\!  
I hate them all\!

She takes up Sephiroth's sword and runs inside. Sephiroth is standing before the door to Jenova's chamber.

**Sephiroth**  
Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door.

Tifa approaches with the Masamune.

**Tifa**  
How could you do that to papa and all the townspeople?

She climbs the stairs and raises the sword over her head to attack him, but Sephiroth pulls the Masamune from her grasp and slashes her. She falls down the stairs, landing near Cloud as he runs in. The door to Jenova's chamber opens, and Sephiroth turns and enters. Cloud kneels to gather Tifa in his arms.

**Tifa**  
...You promised... You promised that you'd come...... when I was in trouble...

He carries her to the side and sets her down, then runs inside Jenova's chamber to confront Sephiroth.

**Sephiroth**  
Mother, let's take this planet back together.  
I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth...  
My family\! My hometown\! How could you do this to them\!?

**Sephiroth**  
Ha, ha, ha...... They've come again, mother.  
With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet.  
But they...  
Those worthless creatures  
are stealing the planet from Mother  
But now I'm here with you  
so don't worry

He reaches up and tears off the mechanical angel figure from the front of Jenova's glass tank, revealing Jenova itself inside.

**Cloud**  
What about MY sadness\!? My family... friends... The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me\!?  
It's the same as your sadness\!

**Sephiroth**  
Ha, ha, ha... my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?  
I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet.  
I have orders to take this planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What am I supposed to be sad about?

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth... I trusted you...  
No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know\!

Cloud and Sephiroth face off, and the screen goes white.

</div>

<span id="end"></span>**Cloud**  
......and that's the end of my story.

**Barret**  
Wait a damn minute\! Ain't there more?

**Cloud**  
......I don't remember.

**Aeris**  
What happened to Sephiroth?

**Cloud**  
In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him.

**Tifa**  
Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.

**Aeris**  
Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information.

**Cloud**  
......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then.  
I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?

**Tifa**  
......I'm alive, too.

**Aeris**  
Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?

**Cloud**  
Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.

**Aeris**  
Did someone else carry it out after that? It was missing from the Shinra building.

**Tifa**  
Sephiroth......?

**Barret**  
Damn\! Don't none of this make sense\!  
I'm going, going, going, gone\!  
And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you\!  
Yo, Cloud\! Let's get a move on\!

**Cloud**  
\- Wait a sec  
\- Right

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Wait a sec</span>

**Barret**  
Cloud, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth heads for the Promised Land?  
I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If they do, then we're all screwed.  
Y'know what I'm sayin'\!

**Cloud**  
\- Beautiful, just beautiful\!  
\- Is that all?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Beautiful, just beautiful</span>

**Barret**  
Y'all jes leave it to me\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Is that all?</span>

Oh brother......

**Barret**  
Fine\! That's good enough.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Right</span>

**Barret**  
Yo, c'mon let's go\!

</div>

Barret runs down the stairs.

**Cloud**  
Oh brother......

**Tifa**  
.........  
Cloud...?  
How bad was I when Sephiroth cut me?

**Cloud**  
I thought you were a goner. ......I was really sad.

**Tifa**  
.........

**Aeris**  
I...  
The Ancients...... Cetra...... Jenova...... Sephiroth and myself......

**Tifa**  
Let's go. Barret's waiting.

Cloud, Aeris, and Tifa head downstairs.

**Red XIII**  
What a fascinating story......

They all join Barret downstairs.

> **Barret**  
> Yo, Cloud. Here.

> **Aeris**  
> Cloud. Take this.

> **Tifa**  
> Oh, Cloud. Let me give you this.

<div class="highlight">

Received "PHS"\!

**Innkeeper**  
20 gil a night. What's it gonna be?

**Cloud**  
\- Stay?  
\- Move on

**Innkeeper** (she only says anything if you don't have enough gil)  
Seems like you're a little short. Why don't you drop by again... when you have money.

Cloud and the others leave the inn.

**Redhead**  
Listen to me\! Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards that grassy field.  
And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary......

With that as their first clue, Cloud and the others set out across the grasslands.

---

<span id="chocobo"></span>Travelling across the grasslands from Kalm, Cloud and the others come across a chocobo farm. In a pen outside, several chocobos are walking about.

**Chocobo**  
Wark\!  
Wark? Warkwark wark?

**Cloud**  
\- Wark  
\- Warrrk

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Wark</span>

The chocobos perform a sort of waltz.

**Chocobo**  
Wark-----

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Choco/Mog" Materia\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Warrrk</span>

**Chocobo**  
Wark\!\! Wark\!\!

</div>

They go inside the house, where they find the owner of the farm.

**Choco Bill**  
Thinking of crossing the marshes?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo.  
That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo.  
It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.  
Midgar Zolom...?  
It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall\!\!  
It picks up on footsteps that enter the marshes...  
And then, BAM\!\! It attacks\!\!\!  
To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at the Choco Bill & Choco Billy Chocobo Farm.  
To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm.  
By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes.  
Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a Black Cape.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Hmm, then, I guess that's that.

</div>

If Cloud enters the bedroom...

**Choco Bill**  
Looking for an Inn?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Choco Bill**  
How about 100 gil a night...?

**Cloud**  
\- All right  
\- I'm in a hurry

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">All right</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Thank you for your patronage.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'm in a hurry</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Hmm, then, I guess that's that.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Hmm, then, I guess that's that.

</div>

Cloud goes to the stables, where two children are tending to the chocobos.

**Chole**  
Welcome.

**Choco Billy**  
Do you want a Chocobo?

**Cloud**  
Mmm......  
\- Give me one  
\- Nope

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give me one</span>

**Choco Billy**  
You old folks are out of luck\!

**Cloud**  
Old folks...?

**Choco Billy**  
We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of those ones out there for someone else.  
You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and catch one.  
Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?

**Cloud**  
\- Where are they?  
\- How do I catch one?  
\- What else?  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where are they?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas.  
But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They very cautious animals by nature.

**Cloud**  
\- Chocobo Lure?  
\- Go on

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Chocobo Lure?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
'Chocobo Lure' is a type of materia which attracts Chocobos.  
If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Go on</span>

Back to the tutorial menu; Cloud can ask any of his initial questions again.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How do I catch one?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters.  
But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters.  
That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo.

**Cloud**  
\- And then?  
\- That all you can talk about?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">And then?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Also, wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the slightest things.  
But, if you use 'Greens' They'll focus on that, and won't run away.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That all you can talk about?</span>

Back to the tutorial menu; Cloud can ask any of his initial questions again.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What else?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt.  
Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape.

</div>

<div class="block">

Not interested

**Choco Billy**  
Well then, shall we get down to business?  
I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now.  
You want it?

**Cloud**  
\- Buy it  
\- Don't buy it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Buy it</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Thanks\!  
It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens' either.  
Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends of what type of 'Greens' you feed them.

Or, if you don't have enough money:

Thanks\!  
Hey, you don't have enough.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't buy it</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one.

If you talk to him again...

**Choco Billy**  
The 'Chocobo Lure' is 2000 gil. Buy it now?

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Oh, I'm so glad\!

</div>

**Chole**  
Wasn't it really expensive?  
But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa.  
Ever since dad and mom died, it's been like this...

After leaving the farm, Cloud catches a chocobo and they cross the marshes, avoiding the Midgar Zolom. On reaching the other side, they find the giant snake impaled on a dead tree and stop to stare.

**Cloud**  
Did Sephiroth... do this......?

> **Barret**  
> This Sephiroth guy's pretty strong, I'd say.
>
> **Aeris**  
> Our enemy is someone that could do this...?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Amazing...

> **Red XIII**  
> It's a power that we should respect...

<span id="mythril"></span>Moving on past this display of power, they enter the Mythril Mines. After navigating through the tunnels, they come across an open cave, where they run into Rude of the Turks.

**Rude**  
Just a second\!

> **Barret**  
> Wh, who are you\!?
>
> **Aeris**  
> By any chance, are you...?
>
> **Tifa**

**Rude**  
Do you know who I am?

**Cloud**  
\- From the Turks, right?  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">From the Turks, right?</span>

**Rude**  
Well if you know, then this won't take long.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Rude**  
......I'm from the Turks. And don't you ever forget it.

</div>

**Rude**  
It's difficult to explain what the Turks do...

**Cloud**  
Kidnapping, right?

**Rude**  
To put it negatively... you could say that.  
...But, that's not all there is to it, anymore.  
............  
............

**Elena**  
Sir\!  
It's all right, Rude\! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it\!

**Rude**  
...Then Elena, explain.

**Elena**  
I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people.  
...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ...  
In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed.  
And to try and stop you every step of the way.  
Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way.

**Tseng**  
...Elena. You talk too much.

**Elena**  
Mr. Tseng\!?

**Tseng**  
No need to tell them about our orders.

**Elena**  
Sorry... Tseng.

**Tseng**  
I thought I gave you other orders.  
Now go. Don't forget to file your report.

**Elena**  
Oh\! Right\!  
Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor\!

**Tseng**  
...Elena. You don't seem to understand.

**Elena**  
Oh\! I'm, I'm sorry...

**Tseng**  
...Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.

**Rude & Elena**  
Yes sir\!

They make their way for the exits. Rude turns back.

**Rude**  
...Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave him healed.  
He wants to show his affection for you all... with a new weapon.

Rude leaves.

**Tseng**  
Well, then...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Aeris is in the party...</span>

**Tseng**  
Aeris... Long time no see.  
Looks like you got away from the Shinra for a while, now that Sephiroth reappeared.

**Aeris**  
...so what are you saying? That I should be grateful to Sephiroth?

**Tseng**  
No...  
Well, I won't be seeing too much of you, so take care.

**Aeris**  
...strange, hearing that from you.

**Tseng**  
Well then, stay out of Shinra's way.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Aeris is not in the party...</span>

**Tseng**  
...Where's Aeris? She's not with you?

**Cloud**  
Aeris isn't with us. She's with the others.

**Tseng**  
Oh... Then give her my regards.

</div>

Tseng leaves, and Cloud and the others continue out of the mines.

<span id="yuffie"></span>Passing through the forests on the way to Junon, they run into a "mystery ninja," who attacks them. After being defeated, she lies on the ground with the party standing around her. There's a save point nearby.

Hey, boobs\! Try that again\! Just one more time\!

### Fort Condor - Fighting the Shinra

#### [Fighting the Shinra](#fighting)

---

On the way to Junon, Cloud and the others may happen across the entrance to Fort Condor.

**\* Note**: Because they can bypass Fort Condor, it's possible to come for the first time at later points in the game, including while Tifa is the party leader, in which case the dialogue is slightly different. Red XIII also has slightly different dialogue after completing the events at Cosmo Canyon.

**Man**  
We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield.  
Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.  
If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?  
Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">On the way to Junon...</span>

**Man**  
Let's see...... Head north along the coast, and keep going for a ways and you'll run into Junon.  
You gotta be careful 'cause it sits in the shadows of a small hill.

Cloud and the others go inside. They find the man by himself in the shed at the top of the fort, looking out the window.

**Man**  
Do you guys want to see it, too?

> **Cloud**  
> See what?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What?

**Man**  
The condors. They're huge. Come on, have a look.

Cloud has a look out the window. A huge condor is nesting close to the Mako reactor that sits atop Fort Condor's hill.

**Man**  
What do ya think? Awesome, huh?

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Hello. I'm sorry but we're not selling anything now.  
We're using everything we have for ourselves.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Sorry, but I can't sell you anything now.

<span id="situation"></span>**Man with Hat**  
Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.  
......Your eyes are different. Well, anyhow. Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra.

(If you talk to him as Tifa, he does not remark on her eyes.)

You'd better get down before you get involved.

> **Barret**

It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here.  
Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?

**Man with Hat**  
Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?

> **Barret**  
> Huh? Something's up there?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Come on, let's get it together.
>
> **Yuffie**

> **Red XIII**

> **Cait Sith**  
> Yeah, come to think of it there was something.

> **Vincent**

> **Cloud**  
> The reactor and the condor.
>
> **Tifa**  
> That's the reactor and the condor.

**Man with Hat**  
I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor.  
It seems the Shinra doesn't like the idea of having a condor on top of the reactor.

> **Barret**  
> Damn, that's one big bird\! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?
>
> **Aeris**  
> Why?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What's so wrong with having a condor on top of the reactor?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> It's not very logical.
>
> Or, after Cosmo Canyon:
>
> The logic eludes me.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> I'm certain there must be state-of-the-art materia inside the reactor. Am I right?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Huh?......
>
> **Vincent**  
> ......That's too much.
>
> **Cid**  
> Huh? I don't get it.

**Man with Hat**  
It seems there's some type of special materia in the reactor above us.  
And because the condors came, the Shinra rushed troops here.  
The military wants to get the condor and all the villagers off this mountain.  
The condors are now warming their eggs, which hatch only once every few years.  
We would like to protect the condors from being harmed.

**Cloud**  
New lives......

> **Barret**  
> I'll do it\! I'll protect them from Shinra\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> We must protect the condor eggs, right?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Condors' eggs. A real work of nature.  
> We've got to protect the life of the planet.
>
> **Red XIII**  
> So, to protect the eggs, are you gonna protect the reactor?......
>
> Or, after Cosmo Canyon:
>
> We're going to protect the reactor in order to save the eggs.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Special materia, huh? Well, well, things are getting interesting.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> I'm gonna leave it up to you all.
>
> **Vincent**  
> ......and come out in one piece?
>
> **Cid**  
> You guys, what are ya gonna do?

**Man with Hat**  
Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.  
That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.  
As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us...  
What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?

I see...... Come back if you should change your mind.

If you talk to him again...

**Man with Hat**  
Have you by chance changed your mind?

**Cloud**  
......  
\- Well, let's do it  
\- My position hasn't changed

**Man with Hat** (once Cloud agrees)  
Whew, we'll be saved.

**Man with Hat**  
Yes, yes, I've also told the store owners about you, so they should sell you various items.  
And feel free to use our beds.  
Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about anything related to our military tactics.

After agreeing to help, the shopkeepers will sell their goods and their dialogue is different.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Hello. Do your best. We will, too.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
You hang in there\!

If you go below to the bedroom...

> **Barret**  
> Ey, let's get some rest.

> **Aeris**  
> Let's rest. Okay?

> **Tifa**  
> Say, let's take a rest. Okay?

> **Vincent**

Cloud goes back up to the shed.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If he didn't agree to help...</span>

**Man**  
So, will you help us? I don't want them to get killed.  
They're gigantic birds and so striking. We simply can't let them be killed by man's selfishness?  
Of course not. There's no way, especially at the hands of Shinra.  
If you're going to go look at them, get on top of that chair over there.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight"><span id="fighting"></span>If he did agree to help...</span>

**Man**  
Thanks for accepting.  
Let me explain our strategy.  
The enemy will climb the mountain looking for the reactor. We will leave a trap for them and hire soldiers to protect the area.  
Well, that's all, but...... This village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.  
If we hired one soldier, we would need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.  
So if you folks have the time, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and command the troops.  
If you're pressed for time we'd like you to help us with the money.  
If you can give us the money, we can then hire soldiers with the funds and block Shinra's attack.  
We know that what we're asking is selfish.  
We have sent our wives and children to another village. We are resigned to our fate.  
Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates our shed, you'll have to fight them immediately.  
Well, just because you lost once, it's not the end of the world, but if you lose repeatedly, it could be dangerous.  
Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?

**Cloud**  
\- Conditions for victory  
\- The enemy  
\- Soldiers, which can be hired  
\- About funding  
\- Other issues  
\- Enough

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Conditions for victory</span>

**Man**  
You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander in charge.  
If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to go into battle immediately.  
In the event that you lose during direct contact, even if the enemy gets to the reactor, there's still a chance to save things.  
But it's only a slight chance, and we have no idea how much the reactor can endure in an attack.  
When we can't stand up to the attack any longer, the Shinra will take both the condors and our lives, as well as all the materia within the reactor.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">The enemy</span>

**Man**  
There are four types of enemies.  
\- Wyverns  
\- Beasts  
\- Barbarians  
\- Commanders  
\- Anything else?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Wyverns</span>

**Man**  
Wyverns are flying types that can move at high speed. Stoner and Tristoner aren't effective against them.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Beasts</span>

**Man**  
Beasts are monster types that do not move quickly, but have explosive attacking power.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Barbarians</span>

**Man**  
Barbarians are human types. They attack indirectly, so you've got to be on your toes.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Commanders</span>

**Man**  
Commanders are the enemy commanders. They're the ones we want to subdue, but they're formidable foes.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Soldiers, which can be hired</span>

**Man**  
Your mobile allies are: Fighters, Attackers, Defenders, Shooters, Repairers and Workers.  
Your immobile allies are: Stoner, Tristoner, Catapult, and Fire Catapult.  
Which do you want to hear about?

**Cloud**  
\- Mobile types

\- Repairers  
\- Workers

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fighters</span>

**Man**  
Fighters are good at defending and attacking, but aren't especially efficient or deficient for any enemy.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Attackers</span>

**Man**  
Attackers move extremely fast and are best for expanding the front line.  
They work good against enemy Beasts, but not enemy Barbarians.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Defenders</span>

**Man**  
Defenders have high endurance, but move slowly. They're best suited for defense.  
Defenders work best against enemy Barbarians, but not enemy Wyverns.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Shooters</span>

**Man**  
Shooters attack indirectly, but has low endurance. Shooters work best against enemy Wyverns, but not enemy Beasts.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Repairers</span>

**Man**  
Repairers repair allied aircraft, but have little attacking power.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Workers</span>

**Man**  
Workers set torpedoes. Torpedoes have strong attacking power, but Workers don't.  
Torpedoes explode when touched by the enemy. The explosions will damage everything in the immediate area.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Immobile types</span>

**Man**  
Which do you want to hear about?  
\- Stoners

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Stoners</span>

**Man**  
Stoners can fire a single boulder, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tristoners</span>

**Man**  
Tristoners can fire three boulders simultaneously, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.  
We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still being developed.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Catapult</span>

**Man**  
Catapults shoot rocks a great distance. causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fire Catapult</span>

**Man**  
Fire Catapults fire bombs a great distance. causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.  
We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still being developed.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">About funding</span>

**Man**  
We have 12000 gil right now.  
We need 3000 gil for each battle.  
How much can you help?

**Cloud**  
\- 500 gil  
\- 1000 gil  
\- 2000 gil  
\- 3000 gil  
\- 5000 gil  
\- We can't help right now

**Man** (if Cloud gives any amount of money)  
Thanks. This makes \[TOTAL\] gil.

Or, if Cloud doesn't have enough money:

We are very grateful, but you don't have enough money.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Other issues</span>

**Man**  
First off, we must prepare the troops.  
Move the cursor wherever the x mark does not appear, then press the O button to set-up.  
After all positions are in place, select by pressing the X button. This starts the battle.  
Soldiers can only be arranged near the shed, in the beginning.  
That's because if the soldiers are too far away, they won't be able to follow instructions.  
You can only put soldiers on the horizontal line at the very bottom.  
Soldiers can be instructed by pushing the select button. So if any commands are unclear, push it.  
Soldiers can report by pushing the O button......  
The cursor will move to the soldier who made the report.  
Press the X button and you'll hear the report without moving.  
And you can bet Shinra will send platoons at you on a regular basis.  
It would be great if you could spare the time to help us...  
But if you really don't have time, would you contribute some financial assistance.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Enough</span>

**Man**  
Hey, this one climbing up here looks like they'd be just right. Please, any help is appreciated...  
Preparations ready?

**Cloud**  
\- Wait  
\- Okay, ready  
\- Contribute gil  
\- Let them handle it

**Man**  
I see, very well then. Maybe, we'll fight together again sometime.

</div>

</div>

</div>

If at length Cloud decides to enter the battle...

**Man**  
You have 10 enemies. There appear to be many Beasts, so you may want to deploy more Attackers.

The battle begins, with Shinra troops climbing the hill towards the reactor, Fort Condor's defenders in the way.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they defeat the enemy...</span>

**Man**  
Whew, that was good. But Shinra's troops will be back.  
Be sure and scout the area well... we don't know when they'll attack again.  
We have X allies left, so here's X gil.  
Oh, yeah. I found this just now on the battlefield. Maybe it'll come in handy for you guys.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the enemy reaches the shed...</span>

**Man**  
My God\! They're attacking\! We're counting on you.

Cloud runs outside to fight the commander.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they win the battle...</span>

**Man**  
We made it through that one somehow. But Shinra'll be back.  
Be sure and scout the area well... we don't know when they'll attack again.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they lose the battle...</span>

**Man**  
Are you all right? Looks like a few got through.

</div>

</div>

**Man**  
How are things going? Seems like there's no activity at Shinra.

On subsequent visits:

**Man**  
Perfect timing\! They're just around the corner. Get ready.

If Cloud accepts but is short on funds:

Hey we're a little short on money... So could you at least make it 4000 gil?

After successfully halting 1-2 assaults:

The Barbarians are mixed during this attack.  
There are more than 20. Set up for a balanced-attack or we'll be in trouble.

After successfully halting 3-5 assaults:

A strong unit's on their way. Looks like around 30.  
They'll probably climb up here using various routes. Better be careful or we'll be in trouble.  
And make sure to deploy Fire Catapults.

After successfully halting 6-8 assaults:

You're probably used to it now, but don't let your guard down.  
Deploy Tristoners.

After successfully halting 9-11 assaults:

Looks like the enemy numbers 40. Don't let your guard down.

After successfully halting 12 or more assaults:

I think you don't need my advice. The rest is up to you.

If it's been a while since your last visit:

**Man**  
How goes it? The Shinra troops have attacked X times since you were here.  
So we're getting a litttle short on funds.  
We have X gil right now.

**Man with Hat**  
Oh, it's you guys? How are things going?

If you've lost battles:

Up to now, you've lost X times. If you lose too many times, you won't be able to come back.

Cloud and the others leave Fort Condor and head for Junon.

<span id="under"></span>Cloud and the others arrive at Junon, walking into the old part of the town, grey and nearly lifeless. At the far end of the little street is an elevator to the upper city guarded by a single Shinra soldier.

**Cloud**  
What happened to this town? It's so run-down...

**Woman**  
Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than the Shinra people visit this town.  
I know you guys want to go to the Western Continent, but the only way is on a Shinra ship.

Inside the Weapon Shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it.

Or, if you speak to him behind the counter:

You want me?

Back outside...

**Fisherman**  
Ever since... Shinra built that city up above during the war, ...ugh, ugh.  
There's been no fish in the water\! It got so polluted... phew...

**Cloud**  
What kinda place is this?

**Older Man**  
Who are you people? Where did you come from?

**Cloud**  
Did you see a man with a black cape?

**Older Man**  
Hmm... I've never seen that feller before.  
There's nothing here now... But it used to be a busy port.

**Elevator Guard**  
HEY\! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around here\!\!

Cloud goes down to the beach, where a little girl is playing with a dolphin.

**Priscilla**  
He-y\! Mr. Dolphin\!  
My name is......  
Pri-scil-la\!  
Now you say it.

She turns around as Cloud approaches.

Who are you guys? Are you members of the Shinra, Inc.?

> **Barret**  
> No\! You got it all wrong\! We're fighting against the Shinra\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> No you're wrong\! We have nothing to do with the Shinra.

> No... stay calm...

> **Red XIII**

> **Yuffie**  
> Hey watch your mouth\! We hate the Shinra\!

**Cloud**  
...that's how it is.

**Priscilla**  
I don't believe you\! Get out of here\!

**Cloud**  
Great...

> **Barret**  
> Hey\! Look at that\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> What's that\!?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Look at that\!
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Hey\! It's a monster\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Whoa, Gawd\!

A sea serpent approaches from deeper out in the ocean.

**Priscilla**  
Be careful Mr. Dolphin\!

She runs out into the water, the serpent attacks her, and she falls unconscious.

**Cloud**  
Hey\! Hold on, we're coming\!

They fight and defeat the sea monster, and then Cloud carries Priscilla ashore.

**Cloud**  
This is bad... You don't think she's dead, do you?

**Older Man**  
Priscilla\!\!

He comes down to kneel near her.

Nope... she's not breathing...  
Hey, that's it\!  
Young man, CPR, now\!

**Cloud**  
Mouth to mouth\!?

> **Barret**  
> C'mon Cloud.
>
> **Aeris**  
> Cloud, hurry\!

> **Yuffie**

**Cloud**  
But, ... she's just a girl......

> **Tifa**  
> Cloud, what are you going to do?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> You know I can't.

**Older Man**  
What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you.

**Cloud**  
Guess I gotta do it...

**Older Man**  
Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her.  
Hurry up and do it\!

If Cloud inhales for too long without giving her CPR:

**Older Man**  
What are you doing\!? Hurry up\! Breath deeply and give her mouth to mouth\!

Eventually Cloud manages to resuscitate the girl.

**Priscilla**  
Uh... ugh...

**Older Man**  
Hey hey\! Priscilla, are you alright?

He picks her up and carries her off. Cloud follows, going up to Priscilla's house.

**Older Man**  
Sorry, Cloud. Priscilla needs to rest for a while.

**Woman** (waiting outside her house)  
Hey, come in for a while.

Cloud and the others follow the woman into her house.

**Woman**  
I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla.  
You all must be tired. If you want to get some rest, stay here.  
Make yourselves at home.

She leaves the house.

**Cloud**  
Yeah...  
\- We'll try later  
\- Let's rest

Cloud and the others turn in for a while.

...That reminds me.

**Cloud**  
You again?  
...Who are you?

...You'll find out soon. ......But more importantly, 5 years ago...

**Cloud**  
5 Years ago... Nibelheim?

When you went to Mt. Nibel then, Tifa was your guide, right?

**Cloud**  
Yeah... I was surprised.

But where was Tifa other than that?

**Cloud**  
...I dunno.

It was a great chance for you two to see each other again.

**Cloud**  
...You're right.

Why couldn't you see each other alone?

**Cloud**  
...I don't know. I can't remember clearly...

Why don't you try asking Tifa?

**Cloud**  
...Yeah.

Then, get up\!

**Tifa**  
Hey wake up. Wake up, Cloud\!

<span id="upper"></span>Cloud wakes to find Tifa standing nearby. There is muffled but lively music in the background.

**Cloud**  
Tifa...  
When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?

**Tifa**  
...We saw each other, right?

**Cloud**  
The other time.

**Tifa**  
No... it was 5 years ago. I don't remember.  
But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick.

Cloud follows her outside.

**Woman**  
For the past few decades, the only thing I've been hearing about is the Shinra.  
I miss the times when we used to talk only about fish...

Cloud finds the others all gathered at the stairs leading up to Priscilla's house.

**Barret**  
Seems like something's goin' on up there\!

**Aeris**  
I heard that girl regained consciousness.

**Tifa**  
Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy all of a sudden...?

**Red XIII**  
Does this have something to do with the Shinra?

**Yuffie**  
What's this loud music? It's giving me a headache\!

Cloud starts up the steps and Priscilla comes out of her house.

**Cloud**  
Are you all right now?

**Priscilla**  
Umm... thanks for helping...  
I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc. ...

**Cloud**  
That's all right.

**Priscilla**  
I'll give you something SPECIAL\!  
It's an amulet. Take good care of it, ok?

<div class="highlight">

Received "Shiva" Materia\!

</div>

**Barret**  
What's that music? It sure sounds lively.

**Priscilla**  
I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra president.

**Barret**  
Rufus\!? I gotta pay my respects.

**Priscilla**  
Grandpa and grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they were small.  
But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped shining here, and the water got polluted...  
I was raised on that story and hate Shinra so much, I could die\!

**Aeris**  
You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too?  
What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?

**Red XIII**  
Cloud, didn't you finish Rufus off?

**Barret**  
We gotta get to the town up there... Mebbe we could climb the tower?

**Priscilla**  
No\! No\! There's a high voltage current running underneath the tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous\!  
But... you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me\!

She runs for the water, but the others hang back.

**Tifa**  
High voltage tower......  
I guess this means Cloud'll be all right.

**Aeris**  
Yeah, better leave it to Cloud\!

**Red XIII**  
We're counting on you, Cloud

**Cloud**  
Hey\!\!  
Wait a second\!

The others disperse, ignoring him. Barret stands near the fisherman, Tifa and Aeris stand talking to each other, and Red XIII and Yuffie stand together.

**Barret**  
Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of Shinra, Inc.\!

**Tifa**  
Don't you just hate this?

**Aeris**  
You're probably right.

**Red XIII**  
That looks like a Shinra soldier.

**Yuffie**  
Aren't you going to follow her?

Cloud goes down to the beach where Priscilla is waiting.

**Priscilla**  
Wait a minute.

She blows a whistle and the dolphin jumps. Barret comes down to join them.

**Barret**  
Now ain't that something\! I ain't never seen no Dolphin jump like that\!

**Priscilla**  
Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps for me.  
Here\!\! This is for you, Cloud\!

**Cloud**  
A gift? What am I supposed to do with it\!?

**Priscilla**  
Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll jump you to the top of the pole\!

**Cloud**  
Jump to the top of the pole?

**Priscilla**  
See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, you can climb to the top of the town.

**Barret**  
Good luck Cloud\! If you make it, we'll follow you\!  
Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet.

**Priscilla**  
You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?

**Cloud**  
\- Explain it to me again  
\- Sure  
\- I'll pass

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Explain it to me again</span>

Priscilla repeats her explanation.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Sure</span>

Cloud goes into the water to begin the jumping-to-the-top-of-the-pole ordeal.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'll pass</span>

**Priscilla**  
Come back whenever you want to see Mr. Dolphin\!

</div>

<span id="rufus"></span>Eventually the dolphin jumps Cloud to the top of the pole, and he climbs up to the Shinra airfield, where the Highwind is. He enters the base to find a group of soldiers running out to the street.

**Soldiers**  
Eh\! Ho\!  
Hurry\! Hurry\!\!  
The new President\!\! He's here, he's here\!\!

**Commander**  
Hey\! You still dressed like that\!? Come 'ere\!

If Cloud tries to run out...

**Commander**  
Hey\! Rookie\!\! Can't you hear me\!\! Come over here\!

**Commander**  
Here\!\! Get in the room\!

Cloud enters the locker room.

**Commander**  
Today's the big day when we welcome President Rufus\! Hurry up and change\!  
There's a uniform in the locker. Hurry and change\!

**Cloud**  
It's the Shinra uniform.  
\- Don't change  
\- Change

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't change</span>

There's Shinra soldiers all around. Better not try anything dumb...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Change</span>

**Commander**  
Quit yappin'\! Hurry up\!

Cloud changes into the Shinra uniform.

**Cloud**  
A Shinra uniform...  
I was so proud when I first put it on.  
I wonder when it was...  
...I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore.

**Commander**  
Wow\! You look good in it\!  
You remember the Greeting procedure, right\!?

Cloud shrugs.

**Commander**  
...the look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show you again\!  
Do just like we do.

Two soldiers run in.

**Soldiers**  
Commander\!\! We'll help too\!  
This is how to do it\!  
We'll sing too\!

**Commander**  
All right\! Show 'em\!\!  
Now, march\!\! This's the Welcoming March\!

**Soldier**  
Then\! I'll sing along with you\!  
Quietly--\!\!  
Aaaaah\!  
Aaaaah\!  
Hey, come on now.

**Commander**  
Now\!

We'll practice some more\!  
Remember to march smoothly\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">All clear\!</span>

**Commander**  
Good\! Make sure you do well at the real parade\!

</div>

Another soldier runs in.

**Soldier**  
Rufus has arrived\! Preparation completed\!

**Commander**  
All right, show time\! Don't disgrace yourselves\!

Elsewhere, in the streets...

**Soldier**  
Begin the Welcome Parade\!

The parade begins. Back to Cloud: The commander, the two soldiers, and Cloud walk out onto an empty street.

**Commander**  
Oh... no...\!\! No one's here\!  
Late---\!?  
Hey Rookie\!\! It's because you're running around like that\!\!

**Soldier**  
Captain\!\! We'll take a short cut\!

**Commander**  
Right\!  
Good idea.  
Get over here\!\!  
All right\! You first\!

If Cloud tries to run away...

**Commander**  
Hey\!\! Don't get me any madder than I already am\!

They go through an alley connecting to the street on which the parade is going by.

**Soldier**  
I'll go first\! Now you watch close and do as I do, rookie\!  
Just sneak into the back of the line when you see an opening.

**Commander**  
Now listen up\! This parade's gonna be broadcast live on Shinra TV, around the world\!  
If you look bad, the whole Junon army will look bad. Remember that and don't screw up\!  
OK\! Jump in when I give you the sign\!  
Just sneak in from the back\! Don't mess up the row\!  
And no matter what you do don't try to go in from the front\!  
All right\!\! Start marching\!\!  
Charge--\!\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud turns around to talk to him instead...</span>

**Commander**  
Just GO\! Then you just nonchalantly sneak in from the back\! Make sure no one sees you\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud stands there unmoving...</span>

**Commander**  
No, what're you doing\!?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud attempts to run off-screen...</span>

**Commander**  
Hey\!\! Don't run away from me\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud runs into the parade in the wrong way...</span>

**Commander**  
Hey\!\! Don't play around\!

</div>

Cloud manages to sneak into the parade as instructed.

**TV Producer**  
What the hell was that soldier doing?

**AD**  
I don't know.

**TV Producer**  
Are the points up?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the ratings are below 30%...</span>

**AD**  
This's terrible\! Am... am I fired?

**TV Producer**  
What\!? You're FIRED\!\!  
Send that soldier a bomb or something\!

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Grenade"\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the ratings are between 31-40%...</span>

Hmm...  
Better send that soldier something.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received 6 "Potion"\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the ratings are between 41-50%...</span>

**TV Producer**  
Really.  
I want somebody to send that soldier an expensive gift.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received 6 "Ether"\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the ratings are over 50%...</span>

**TV Producer**  
We did it\!  
Send that soldier something special.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received 5000 gil\!

</div>

</div>

Cloud and the others join a group of soldiers drilling in front of Rufus and Heidegger.

**Commander**  
Good\! We made it.  
Oh\! President Rufus\!  
Hey\! Line up and shut up\!  
Don't make a move\!

The soldiers finish their show. Heidegger turns to Rufus.

**Rufus**  
How's the job?  
What happened to the Airship?

**Heidegger**  
The long range airship is still being prepared.  
It should be ready in about three more days. Gya haa haa\!

**Rufus**  
Even the Air Force's Gelnika?

**Heidegger**  
......Gya haa haa\!

**Rufus**  
Stop that stupid horse laugh.  
Things are different than when father was in charge.

**Heidegger**  
Gya...

**Rufus**  
Is the ship ready?

**Heidegger**  
Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly.

Rufus turns and climbs up into the lift into the base. Heidegger turns to his group and charges. Everyone but Cloud flees. Heidegger punches Cloud and then runs after Rufus. The soldiers gather around Cloud.

**Soldiers**  
What a disaster.  
Heidegger was really irritated...  
The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't find him.

**Cloud**  
Man in a Black Cape?

**Soldiers**  
He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our soldiers.  
He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around that it was Sephiroth.

**Commander**  
Attention\! Dismissed\!

The soldiers leave, and the commander walks up to Cloud.

**Commander**  
Hey\! Hey you\! You messing with the army?

**Cloud**  
\- Who cares?  
\- What if I am?

**Commander** (he says the same thing regardless)  
You're too lazy\!\! No break for you\!\!  
Get over here\!

The commander takes Cloud back to the locker room.

**Commander**  
This is the military, soldier\!\! Your orders for today are to send off President Rufus at the dock\!  
I'll keep drilling you until it's time\!

The two soldiers come back in.

**Soldiers**  
I'll help, sir\!  
Me too, sir\!

**Commander**  
All right\!\! Line up in order and show me your final pose\!  
Today's command is Formation\!  
Remember it\!  
Ready\!?  
Junon Military Send Off, BEGIN\!\!

The soldiers practice the send off.

**Commander**  
All right\! Now you try it\!

Cloud practices with them.

**Commander**  
So, you got it?

**Cloud**  
\- Not yet\!  
\- I've got it\!

**Commander**  
All right\! Don't mess up during the real thing\!

**Soldier**  
Commander\!\! What's today's special pose?

**Commander**  
Huh? ...I haven't decided yet.  
All right, rookie\!\! I'll let you decide\!  
Show me your best move\!

**Cloud**  
Let's see... My best move is...

He twirls his gun over his head the same way he twirls his sword after a battle.

**Soldiers**  
Woo----ow\!  
That's awesome\!

**Commander**  
All right\!\! We'll go with that as today's special\!\!  
Practice it\!

**Soldiers**  
Yes sir\!\!

**Commander**  
Well then\! Meet at the dock\!\! Don't be late\!\!  
Attention\! Dismissed\!\!

<span id="explore"></span>If Cloud goes back down the elevator...

**Elevator Guard**  
What? It's not time for our shift, yet. Just relax.

**Cloud**  
Uh... yea......

He gets back on the elevator to the upper city.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Come on, forget about your job\! Step right up\!\!

Cloud enters the shop.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Welcome\!  
I was just starting to get worried... You see our sales were pretty bad today.

Next door...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
I've got nothing to sell to you\! Come back later\!

In the bar below, Rude is smoking at a table with a group of bald men.

**Barkeeper**  
I'm sorry\! It's all rented out today\!

**Rude**  
Mm...? You too?  
Then, take your mask off and come here. That's our rule.

**Man with Head on Table**  
Looks like something's going on outside, but we're too smashed to do anything...  
Ooh, oohh... Oh man, my head's burning up...

**Bald Man in Suspenders**  
Seems like you're all a little too young to be in here.

**Big Bald Man**  
Seaweed... Seaweed...

In the item shop...

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Oh, a Soldier\! Welcome\!

Inside the barracks...

**Man in Plainclothes**  
Hey, how could you do that\!? Nobody woke me up\!  
And I can't find the uniform I left in my locker, either. I wonder if I left it somewhere...  
Geez\! Do you think this could be... what they call 'bullying?'  
Oh man, My future in the military, is pretty bleak.

**Soldier**  
Hmm? A know-it-all, huh?  
All right\!\! Come in\!\!

Cloud goes downstairs to the Respectable Inn.

**Soldier**  
This is a Respectable Inn... guests only\!  
You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.

**Soldier 2**  
Ok wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off some stress.

**Cloud**  
You're right...  
\- Growth Materia  
\- Kinds of Materia  
\- Combinations of Materia  
\- Divisions of Materia  
\- Numbers of Materia that you may carry  
\- The rest is a secret

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Growth Materia</span>

**Cloud**  
First off, the main points.  
Some types of Materia, like Magic, grow as you use them.  
Some, like Summon Magic, grow from being used once a battle, to several times per battle.  
Their effectiveness changes too. ...There are all different kinds.  
Some types don't change, but they must grow in order to be divided.  
...And that's it. Maybe that sounded too official.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Kinds of Materia</span>

**Cloud**  
Types of Materia... Here goes...\!  
\[Independent Materia\] enables Abilities. No linking required.  
\[Support Materia\] is used with Command, Magic, and Summon Materia.  
You must equip them in linked slots or they won't be any good.  
\[Command Materia\] lets you use new commands.  
There are lots of different kinds of Materia, so you'll never get bored. One called \[Attack\] changes itself.  
\[Magic Materia\] is easy. You can use Magic, and as your Level increases, you'll learn new Magic.  
\[Summon Materia\] let's you use Summon Magic. As your Level increases, the number of times you can use it in a single battle increases.  
This's one of my favorites.  
And there you have it, the five types of Materia.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Combinations of Materia</span>

**Cloud**  
There's no single way to combine Materia. So here goes the basics.  
Support Materia... The basic combination is Magic + All.  
The variety of magic you can cast will increase as your Magic Level increases.  
When your All level increases, so does the number of times you can use it in a battle. That about covers it.  
Huh? Wait a sec...  
You can change between Magic-All and Magic with the L1/R1 buttons. I'll bet you've probably already done this.  
One effective combination is Elemental + Summon Materia.  
If you equip this combination to your weapon, you can put Magic and Summon Elementals on your weapon.  
For example, if you equip Fire + Elemental to your sword, you will end up with Fire Elemental Sword.  
I'm getting off the subject,... If you equip Fire + Elemental to your armor, it will have twice the resistance to fire damage.  
Now this is important. When the Elemental levels in your armor increase, so will their effectiveness. From half damage - no damage - absorb.  
If you combined Elemental and Fire you could develop Fire absorbing armor.  
Wait, there's more. Next is the Added Effect for Support Materia.  
The Added Effect Materia grafts the effects of Compound Status Materia into your weapons and armor.  
For example, equip Added Effect + Poison to your weapon and select \[Attack\].  
Sometimes you'll give a Poison status. Of course, it doesn't always work.  
If you don't combine the Added Effect Materia with Status Change Materia, like Confusion or Time, you won't get any effect.  
To learn more about Added Effect, access the menu and check the Status.  
It's a little hard to get, but if you take your time, you'll be all right.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Divisions of Materia</span>

**Cloud**  
Division... I'm pretty good at this.  
People tell me that my personality is divided. But I don't think so, but maybe it is...  
Anyhow...  
Once your Materia reaches the maximum Level, it will divide.  
The original Materia will no longer grow. Once that happens, all you can do is use it as it is.  
New Materia always starts out with zero AP, so you need to raise its levels\!  
Of course, once the new Materia reaches its max, it'll divide. That's how you increase your Materia collection.  
Ha, ha...... Right now I feel like I'm dividing myself.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Numbers of Materia that you may carry</span>

**Cloud**  
Once Materia starts dividing, you must be careful.  
There's a limit to how much Materia you can have.  
Since we're fighting for the life of the Planet, it goes against my beliefs carrying too much Materia.  
Either way, I don't really care, but... I'll leave it up to you.  
That's why, the amount of Materia that we can have is limited to 200... only what we can equip.  
When you have too much Materia, you need to dispose of some. If you don't, you can't take on any more.  
So, ditch some Materia before that happens... Ahem... I mean, give them back to the Planet.

</div>

**Soldier 3**  
Ok. Expert\! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?

**Cloud**  
I don't have too much to say about that...  
\- Developing Limits  
\- Extreme Limits  
\- That's it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Developing Limits</span>

**Cloud**  
There are 2 basic ways of building up your Limit techniques. First, just use them\!  
And second is to finish off as many enemies as possible\! It sounds easier than it is.  
Everyone knows that when you gain a new Limit technique, you need to select it in the menu.  
And you knew that you won't be able to use advanced techniques on each level if you haven't used the basic ones.  
Since the type and growth for each limit techniques is different, that's about all I will say.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Extreme Limits</span>

**Cloud**  
A long time ago I heard extreme techniques exist within the Limit techniques.  
But, if that's true you wouldn't be able to get it in any normal way. That's about all I know about it.

</div>

**Ghost**  
This is the Beginner's Hall (Intermediate)\!  
Your explanations were so complicated I couldn't return to the Planet.  
So, I have a right to ask you again.

**Cloud**  
What do you want to know?  
\- How to save?  
\- How do I cure party members?  
\- Curative Magic  
\- Weapons and armor  
\- How to apply Materia  
\- Effective ways to use Materia  
\- Battle formation  
\- Checking status  
\- Limit Techniques  
\- Other  
\- You got nothing to teach me\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How do I cure party members?</span>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud doesn't have any potions in his inventory...</span>

**Cloud**  
For my explanation, I'll need a Potion.

**Ghost**  
Man, ex-SOLDIER's sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion...

Cloud will then proceed with his explanation.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud has already gotten a free potion from the ghost...</span>

**Cloud**  
For my explanation, I'll need a Potion.

**Ghost**  
I don't seem to have any on me. Why don't you go buy one?

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Other</span>

**Cloud**  
I think you know the basics, but just in case...  
Do not open the PlayStation or change discs until instructed.  
If you open the Disc Cover, I can't guarantee anything. That is all.

</div>

Cloud's tutorials are otherwise identical to those he gives in Sector 7's [Beginner's Hall](02.html#beginner).

**Ghosts 2 & 3**  
Ok, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER\! Let me revenge... I mean, review\!

**Cloud**  
What do you want to review?  
\- ATB  
\- Onscreen numbers  
\- Change and Defend  
\- Escape  
\- Gauges  
\- Status  
\- Elementals  
\- Help  
\- That's all

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">ATB</span>

**Cloud**  
ATB means Active Time Battle. It's a system in which time continuously runs during battle.  
If the ATB is changed to \[WAIT\] in the Config Menu... Time stops during battle while you select magic or an item.  
That lets you select your commands carefully. It's geared especially for beginners like you.  
In config, if you change from ATB to \[Recommended\]... Time will stop while magic or item effects are displayed.  
This lets you watch the effects carefully. Letting you fight at your own pace... this is the way to go.  
I always use ACTIVE mode, but choose what you want. That's all.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Onscreen numbers</span>

**Cloud**  
During a battle, white numbers that appear on the screen indicate damage, and green numbers indicate recovery points.  
Remember that, if you don't want to be wiped out.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Change and Defend</span>

**Cloud**  
Change will change your fighting position to either the front or back row.  
If you select the back row, the amount of damage you receive is reduced, but so is your attacking power.  
\[Change\] can be selected from the battle menu by pushing the \[left Directional button\].  
You can also select \[Defend\] from battle menu by pushing the Directional button to the right.  
Defend will reduce your damage by half until your next turn.  
It's better to use Defend for strong enemies. Of course, I don't need anything like that.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Escape</span>

**Cloud**  
I don't know too much about Escape during battles since I never do it, but... someone like you might need it.  
You can escape by holding down the L1 and R1 buttons during battle.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Gauges</span>

**Cloud**  
It might be hard to understand this next one since you can't check it right now, but just listen.  
I'm talking about the Gauges displayed during battle.  
Time Gauge shows the time remaining until your next turn during battle.  
You can enter a command once the Gauge is full, but if you don't want to enter a command, press the △ button to skip to the next person.  
This is good when you want to make Barret work.  
The Limit Gauge increases as you receive damage. When this is full, you are able to use a Limit Technique.  
The Limit Gauge doesn't reset after each battle, so it will build up the more damage you get in battle.  
The trick is knowing when to use it instead of using it as soon as it becomes available.  
You may already know this, but I'll tell you anyways. Status has two conditions: Fury and Sadness.  
Fury speeds up your Limit Gauge, but decreases your concentration.  
Sadness slows down your Limit Gauge, but also decreases the damage you receive. Keep this in mind.  
Barrier Gauge shows the time available for special magic effects.  
The top gauge Barrier, defends against attacks. And the bottom gauge Magic Barrier, defends against magic spells.  
Both reduce the amount of damage by half, but disappear after several uses.  
Always keep an eye on the Barrier Gauge, when using Barrier and Magic Barrier spells.  
That's all. Check them out next time you're in a battle.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Status</span>

**Cloud**  
Status simply means the status of the characters.  
I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll mention the main points.  
Sleep  
Cannot enter command until awakened.  
Poison  
Rapidly decreases HP during battle.  
Fury  
Doubles damage, reduces concentration. Tranquilizer cures it.  
Sadness  
Damage reduced. Hyper cures it.  
Petrify  
Turns you into stone. If entire party is petrified, You'll get Wiped Out.  
Confusion  
You cannot distinguish between enemy and ally.  
Silence  
You cannot cast any Magic.  
Paralysis  
Time Gauge stops, you cannot enter commands.  
Darkness  
Reduces attack concentration.  
Frog  
Turns you into a frog. I hate this.  
Phew...I'm tired.  
Changed Status can be changed with magic and items, so always double check it when you buy things.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Elementals</span>

**Cloud**  
Elementals are special Elementals that come with magic and weapons.  
You have to use this to your advantage in battle.  
Only once you start thinking in terms of Elementals can you truly be called an intermediate player.  
Here are some examples. Remember, they're just examples. You don't have to memorize them.  
Fire  
Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.  
Ice  
Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.  
Lightning  
Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.  
Earth  
Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.  
Poison  
Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison based enemies.  
Gravity  
Gravity based attack. These hurt if they hit.  
Water  
Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.  
Wind  
Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.  
Holy  
Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.  
Using opposite Elementals often is effective in battle.  
Using the same Elementals usually increases Defense.  
But, the reverse is also true. Watch out for it.  
To find out what Elementals an enemy has, you need Sense Materia. Once you get it, try it out.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Help</span>

**Cloud**  
If you don't understand what I just told you, I guess you just have a limited capacity for information.  
But, relax. Push the \[SELECT\] Button during battle.  
A Help Message should explain the different commands to you.  
It'll tell you things like the monsters' names, even I look at it, sometimes... So don't be ashamed to use it.

</div>

On up to the third floor...

**Soldier Studying**  
Mmm? I'm not going to the parade.  
The road to becoming SOLDIER First Class is very difficult.  
Don't mind me.  
As a man with promise and future, I don't have any time to fool around like the rest of you.

Cloud goes on towards the port...

**Soldier Guarding Upper Junon Lift**  
President Rufus is being sent off at the port.

**Sailor Outside Underwater Reactor**  
What is it? The elevator's out of order right now due to an inspection.  
You know, right under us, is a Submarine Dock and the Underwater Mako Reactor.  
Mako energy puts a lot of wear and tear on the machinery.  
A lot of problems can pop up. So it's necessary for close inspections and maintenance.

**Soldier Guarding Lower Junon Lift**  
Oh\! How's it going\!? If you're looking for Junon dock, it's over there\!  
This lift goes to the Shinra section...  
Ever since that Black-caped murderer... But we can't use it because we're all on red alert.

Inside Shinra's member bar...

**Barkeeper**  
Hey soldier-boy, aren't you still on duty?

**Tseng**  
Stay outta this.

**Reno**  
The President's safety is secure because we're here.

**Elena**  
The minute you think the job's boring, you guys start messing around.

Inside Junon Inn...

**Innkeeper**  
Are you sure it's all right?  
Nap while on duty?  
\- 30 gil  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">30 gil</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Enjoy your stay.

Cloud rests.

**Innkeeper**  
Good morning\! You still seem a little sleepy.  
Looking forward to seeing you again.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Come again.

</div>

On the second floor...

**Girl**  
Please\! Come in...

Cloud enters the Materia Shop.

**Girls**  
Welcome\!

**Redhead**  
I won't charge you for a smile...

**Black-haired girl**  
Buy a lot, cutie\!

**Girl**  
Please go to the counter.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
There's lots of stores in Junon.  
If we don't do this... we can't compete.  
But, what bothers me is that the girls make more than me.

Cloud leaves the shop.

**Girls**  
Thank you very much\!

On the third floor...

**Accessory Shopkeeper**  
I used to be in SOLDIER... Once I left, I opened up this shop...  
But to tell you the truth, I'd rather be at the shop downstairs.

Inside another barracks...

**Soldier**  
Hey\! Aren't you still on duty\!?  
Look, I'm in no position to talk, but...  
Don't become a delinquent worker like me.

On the second floor...

**Shinra Manager**  
It's so shameful\!  
...and they told me that I would be staying at five star hotels on these trips...  
How can you guys sleep in a place like this?

Inside the Weapons Shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Oh\! Welcome\!  
We don't have anything special now. I kind of messed up the last time I ordered but feel free to look around\!

<span id="docks"></span>Cloud finally goes to the dock and lines up with the other soldiers. Red XIII is watching from just inside the ship's cargo hold.

**Commander**  
All right, it's time\!  
Ten... HUT\!

**Soldier**  
President Rufus... has now arrived\!

A door opens and Rufus and Heidegger emerge.

**Commander**  
This is it\!\! Junon Military Reception--\!  
Do it right---, Do it with enthusiasm...\! Ready...\!

Cloud and the soldiers perform the send-off exercises they practiced earlier.

**Commander**  
All right\! Now finish strong\!\!  
SPECIAL---\!\!

<div class="block">

**Rufus**  
Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, Cloud and his friends will show up, too.

**Heidegger**  
We'll crush them as soon as we find them\!

**Rufus**  
We can't have them get in our way.

**Heidegger**  
Leave it up to me, sir\! Gya haa ha\!

**Rufus**  
I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh...

He turns and gets on the ship.

**Heidegger**  
Gya......

He charges for the soldiers, but a whistle sounds and he turns to run on the ship.

**Commander**  
All right\! Dismissed\!

**Soldiers**  
That was close.  
Heidegger's been really edgy lately.  
Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation.  
Heidegger's been forced to take care of that investigation, too.

**Commander**  
Hey--\! I thought you were dismissed\!

Three of the soldiers leave, but one runs onto the ship.

**Commander**  
We got some cleaning up to do\! Hurry up\!

Inside the cargo hold, Red XIII is just visible.

**Red XIII**  
Hey, hurry. You're the last one.

**Cloud**  
How did you get here?

**Red XIII**  
A dolphin gave me a ride.  
Priscilla remembered the dolphin after you climbed the pole. But, you mustn't be mad at her.

Instead of following the others away from the dock, Cloud, too, sneaks onto the ship.

**Cloud**  
We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent.  
...even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms...

<span id="explore"></span>In the cargo hold, there are a few others in Shinra uniform. The sailors are busy with various tasks and the soldiers are apparently standing guard...

**Sailor**  
I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?  
The new President's probably the same.  
He's just gonna order us around anyway.

**Yuffie**  
Urrrgh... This is why... I hate ships.  
Hey, Cloud. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?

**Cloud**  
\- Here, use this  
\- Nope

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Here, use this</span>

**Yuffie**  
Thanks... Gross... this is bitter.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope</span>

**Yuffie**  
...unless it's an emergency get away from me.

</div>

**Yuffie**  
Where are the others?  
I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?  
How should I know...? Ugh...... urk......

Cloud jumps back, and moves on to find the others.

**Aeris**  
Umm...... It's me Aeris.  
Hey, Cloud. Did you see the Airship at Junon?

**Cloud**  
...I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big.

**Aeris**  
That was REALLY something.  
Hey, do you think I could get on it?

**Cloud**  
\- I'll take you someday  
\- I dunno...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'll take you someday</span>

...keep hoping.

**Aeris**  
Wow\! I'm really looking forward to it\!  
Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I dunno...</span>

...It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.

**Aeris**  
...Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.  
Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.

</div>

**Sailor 2**  
It won't do any good trying to stop me\!  
All right\! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of\!

**Soldier**  
Hey, get to work\!  
Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship\!  
If we do good, we could get promoted\!

Cloud goes up to the deck. He finds Tifa up on the lookout tower.

**Tifa**  
Yes sir\! Everything quiet, sir\!  
...But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.  
Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.  
They take away all the things and people you love...  
I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah......  
\- I don't know

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah......</span>

Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not...

**Sailor 3**  
President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one\!

**Sailor 4**  
Hey\! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep\!

A soldier stands blocking the way to the front of the ship.

**Soldier 2**  
Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.  
When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan...

**Red XIII**  
......  
......It's me.  
Red XIII.  
I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.  
Humans only look at appearances anyway.  
Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.

He turns around, showing his tail sticking out the back of his uniform.

It's pretty hard standing on two feet...

Back in the cargo hold...

**Aeris**  
Hey, Cloud. Did you see Barret?  
I hope he's not doing anything stupid...

Cloud goes back up to find Barret just outside the bridge, watching Rufus and Heidegger through the window.

**Barret**  
Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger.  
They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em...  
Ummmm...... Gmmmmm......  
How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that?  
Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......\!

**Barret**  
Damn, did they find us\!?  
Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean... Tifa and the others\!?  
Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud\!

Barret and Cloud join the others gathered on the deck of the ship.

**Tifa**  
Everyone all right\!?

**Barret**  
You all right\!?

**Aeris**  
Huh?

**Tifa**  
Everyone's here... right?

**Barret**  
Hey, wait.  
You don't think that suspicious character is...

**Someone**  
Sephiroth\!?

**Tifa**  
Really\!?

**Barret**  
How the hell am I supposed to know\!?

**Cloud**  
...Let's find out.

**Red XIII**  
It's the most logical thing to do. Then, who's going to go?

**Yuffie** (backing away)  
N, not me...  
I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid...... ugh...... urk......

I'm goin' too\!

**Aeris**

I told you... I don't want... to, ugh...... urk......

**Sailor 4**  
Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew.  
Oh well, seamen never bother with details\!  
How you feelin'\!

**Cloud**  
\- I'm tired...  
\- Something's missing  
\- Leave me alone

<span id="sephiroth"></span>Cloud the others go down into the cargo hold, where two sailors and a soldier lie motionless on the floor.

**Soldier**  
...the Engine Room... ...a suspicious...... character...  
No...... there's no way...... that...... not a human...... That thing's not human......  
.........

Cloud enters the engine room and walks up to the one soldier still standing.

**Cloud**  
Is it...... Sephiroth?

The man turns around and collapses.

**Cloud**  
No... not Sephiroth\!

**Sephiroth**  
......After a long sleep...  
...the time......  
...time has...... come...

> Cloud, look\!\!

Sephiroth rises up through the floor of the engine room.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth\! You're alive\!

**Sephiroth**  
......Who are you?

**Cloud**  
You don't remember me\!? I'm Cloud\!

**Sephiroth**  
Cloud...

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth\! What are you thinking\!? What are you doing\!?

**Sephiroth**  
...the time...... is now...

**Cloud**  
What\!? What are you saying\!? Be more......

Sephiroth flies off through the ceiling, and Cloud's party enters a battle with Jenova∙BIRTH, fighting and defeating it. A small tentacle-like piece remains after the battle.

**Cloud**  
...Jenova. The arm of Jenova.

**Cloud**  
So it WAS Sephiroth.

>
> **Yuffie**  
> So what's the story?  
> Hey Cloud. Give us a quick run down.

**Cloud**  
\- I'll try  
\- Too much trouble _\[With this choice, he doesn't say anything more.\]_

**Cloud**  
...I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.  
Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago.  
Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.  
And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.  
He was carrying Jenova with him.  
...This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova.  
...I guess that's about it.

The others start for the exit. Cloud turns back to look at where Sephiroth was.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth... is alive...  
The Promised Land... Does it really exist...?

The cargo ship continues on to dock at Costa del Sol.

<span id="arrival"></span>The cargo ship arrives in Costa del Sol, and everyone gets off. Yuffie runs over to talk to one of the locals before joining the group.

**Barret**  
Damn\! Sure is hot here\!  
But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.  
Yo listen up\!\! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here\!

**Aeris**  
Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor suit.  
He looked so cute.

**Barret**  
......What'ya mean "cute"?

**Tifa**  
Right... well, uh...  
Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?  
Right, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- I guess  
\- Keep your mind on Sephiroth

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I guess</span>

Ahhh...... You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.

**Barret**  
The hell's that supposed to mean\!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Keep your mind on Sephiroth</span>

Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.  
I'm going on ahead.

**Barret**  
Hmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time. I'm going to skip this resort\!

</div>

**Red XIII**  
...puff... puff...  
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.

**Yuffie**  
Yeah, mine, too\!\!

**Cloud**  
All right. We'll take a break and then head off.  
Don't wander too far off.

**Barret**  
I'll wander wherever I damn well want\! Who made him the leader?

Barret runs off.

**Aeris**  
Maybe I should get a tan for a change.  
Which do you like, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- I like fair complexions.  
\- Maybe a healthy tan is nice.

**Aeris** (she says the same thing regardless)  
Got it. I'll remember that.

**Tifa**  
I think I'll go swimming.

**Aeris**  
Sounds good to me\!  
Hmm? Cloud, are you thinking of anything in particular?  
Your cool exterior's cracking...  
Well then, let's go\!

She and Tifa run off.

**Red XIII**  
It looks like my mane got messed up.  
I'm going to rest somewhere cool.

He slinks away.

**Yuffie**  
Don't bother looking for me\!

She runs off.

**Sailor**  
You're stowaways, right?  
It's okay. I'm used to them.  
The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.  
Costa del Sol... a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round\!  
Hmm...... Things aren't going well...... You can go sightseeing in the city.

**Sailor Running Around**  
Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President.  
It seems like he's here on business this time.  
I'm so jealous of him, I could spit. We're both about the same age, but, he's President.

**Sailor on the Helipad**  
Oh crap... The manager of Shinra won't come down.  
Even though the President's here on business. All he does is play, forgetting everything to do with work.

**Woman Lounging on Sea Plane**  
But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand.  
On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever... Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna.  
It's the ultimate high\!

**Man Near Sea Plane**  
Heh, heh... I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.  
Heh, heh...\! Got nothing to do with us, does it?

<span id="shinra"></span>Cloud leaves the dock, and Shinra's helicopter lands on the helipad as Rufus and Heideggar get off the ship.

**Rufus**  
What a long boat ride that was\!\!  
Hmmm...... Good work everyone......

**Heidegger**  
Gya, Heh, heh..., ha\!\! Hurry up with that\!

**Sailor**  
Yes, sir\!\!

**Rufus**  
I heard Sephiroth was on board.

**Heidegger**  
......Yes.

**Rufus**  
And it seems Cloud and the others were on board, too.

**Heidegger**  
......Yes.

**Rufus**  
They all slipped through...... You messed up big this time, Heidegger.

**Heidegger**  
I'm ashamed of myself.

**Rufus**  
Is that all you can do...?  
Give one word answers and apologize for everything?

**Sailor**  
Ready for departure, sir\!\!

**Rufus**  
......Do something. I'll be expecting results.

He walks to the helicopter, and Heidegger charges the sailors, throwing them into the ocean. The helicopter takes off.

---

<span id="explore"></span>Back to Cloud. If he goes back to the harbor...

**Man Near Sea Plane**  
Hey\! Spread out, all of you, out\!\!  
Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head\!  
Da plane, da plane\!\! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime.  
So you just watch from a distance... and wish.

**Woman Lounging on Sea Plane**  
He's quite handsome, isn't he?......  
Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.  
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond... He even looks good in a double-breasted suit.

**Sailor**  
Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.  
Oops\! You must be those AVALANCHE guys\!  
Quick\! Let's get outta here\! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship.  
That's tough for both of us.  
The transport ship won't be sailing for quite a while. Heidegger's orders.

**Sailor Running Around**  
Rufus complimented me on my job\!  
Wow\!\! I guess it pays to do good work.

**Shinra Manager**  
Oh, oh, oh\!\!\! I'm gonna quit this company\!\!  
I mean it, I'm really gonna quit\!\!  
Heidegger's such an idiot\!\!  
And Rufus, acting all big\!\!  
God, that sure felt good...

Back to the town...

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
Say, aren't you bored?

**Cloud**  
\- Not that much  
\- Yeah, we fight a lot

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not that much</span>

Oh, really? I'm a little bored.  
Come on, back to work now\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, we fight a lot</span>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.

</div>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
Here you are\! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.  
What do you want to know?

**Cloud**  
\- Where's the inn?  
\- Where're the stores?  
\- Show me around town.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where's the inn?</span>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where're the stores?</span>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.

<span class="highlight">Show me around town</span>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook.  
It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West. And has a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.  
Come on\! I don't care about that\!  
If you want a good time, come to the beach\! There are lots of beautiful women.  
You wouldn't happen to be... rich?

**Cloud**  
\- Oh yeah...  
\- Well, not so

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Oh yeah...</span>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
You're kidding\! You can't tell just by looking.  
But I'll tell you just in case.  
After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play\!  
Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.  
But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.  
But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Well, not so</span>

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
I thought so.  
Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.  
Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.  
But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.

Cloud enters a nearby villa, and finds a suited man resting in the bedroom.

**Man**  
What a fluffy bed...... feels so great......  
Mmm... Just a little longer......  
Oh\!\!  
Oh, I'm sorry...... I didn't know you were here. This is embarrassing.  
Take your time and look around.  
By the way, are you seriously considering buying?

**Cloud**  
\- The heck do ya mean?  
\- I'm out of here

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">The heck do ya mean?</span>

What are you selling?

**Man**  
That's pretty low. Are you pulling my leg?  
I'm talking about this house. This villa used to belong to President Shinra. It only recently came back on the market.  
How do you like it?  
It has a large lot, comes fully furnished with this goose-down bed, and there's even a basement to boot.  
The villagers call it the Shinra Villa.  
Of course, we're not giving it away...

**Cloud**  
\- How much is it?  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How much is it?</span>

**Man**  
Wha? How do you plan to buy it without a dime on you?  
Well, I'll tell the price just for your information.  
It's a steal at 300,000 gil. Out of your range? Out\! Go on, out\!  
Hmm... Is this some kind of joke?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Man**  
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue.  
Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa?  
The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply... how should I say? ...indescribable.  
Well, let's wait for the captain.

</div>

'Praise the Lord,' it's a miracle\!\! Who'd ever think someone with some real money would ever come here...... I probably shouldn't even ask, but Are you really going to buy it?

**Man**  
Hmm, good-bye\!\! Good-bye fluffy bed\!\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I changed my mind</span>

**Man**  
Oh well I'm kind of glad\!

</div>

**Cloud**  
This is MY villa. Rest up in your new villa?  
\- With pleasure  
\- Gotta move on

In the basement, there is a man sleeping at his desk amidst bunch of crates.

**Manager**  
Yes sir\!\!  
Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself.  
...SNORE... SNORE...  
Geez my lower back's killing me\!  
Y, yes... sir\!\!  
How do you do\! I'm the Manager.  
Nice to meet you.  
Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night.

In the corner pub, from whose window a woman peeks out occasionally.

**Waitress**  
You want drink? Iz ok. You take time.

**Surfer**  
We're all headin' over to Gold Saucer now.  
We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races.  
Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.

**Surfer 2**  
Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year.  
I'm sick of surfing.

**Black Man**  
...huff... puff... I can't stand hot places...

**Man**  
......HIC... Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.

**Mukki**  
I really like this town.  
You could walk around nearly naked, and no one'd look twice at you.

**Man in Corner**  
Come on... please. If you don't buy from me... I can't make ends meet.

**Barkeeper**  
Welcome to Bar del Sol\! Here's to tropical nights\!

**Woman Behind Counter**  
Hey\! I thought you'd drop by.  
(That's 1, 2... 4 fishes all together...... not bad.)

Back outside...

**Women Walking Around**  
Shall we play our hand around here?  
Not yet. Remember, no compromises.  
You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.  
But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.  
Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach.  
I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.  
Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.  
Not yet. Remember, no compromises.

Nearby, Red XIII is sitting in the shade, hitting a soccer ball around with two kids.

**Red XIII**  
Hm, that's interesting.  
It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.  
You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will.

**Little Girl**  
I heard. That big dog talks like a human.  
That's cool... but it's weird.

If Cloud kicks the soccer ball at Red XIII, he'll jump up and growl at him.

**Red XIII**  
Grrr.......

**Little Boy**  
1, 2, 3, here we go\!

If Red XIII is in your party, the kids are playing by themselves.

**Little Girl**  
It's the ocean. A creepy man was signaling for us to come.  
I was scared to come here\!

**Butch**  
Well, we're lucky to have that cutie working for us part-time.

**Yuffie**  
Ah, Cloud\! Let me make a buck why don't you?  
I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some\!?

If Yuffie is in your party, Butch is tending the shop by himself.

**Butch**  
Yeah, I'd like to hire a gorgeous chick and have a great time.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
How about a 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made especially in Costa del Sol\!

Inside the inn, Barret is in the bathroom in his sailor outfit, posing in front of the mirror.

**Barret**  
Uh uh\!  
Hmmm\!?  
Marlene\! You ok?......  
Dad'll wear this when I go to see you.  
Uh uh\!  
Hey, yo\!\!\! Someone's in here, awright\!?

**Innkeeper**  
Uggh\! I feel God awful\! Oh\!\! You\!  
Weren't you the one with that big sailor?

**Cloud**  
\- Dunno what you're talking about  
\- Wasn't me

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Dunno what you're talking about</span>

What's the matter?

**Innkeeper**  
Listen to this...  
All of a sudden, this big sailor just busts in here, and takes over the restroom.  
He's been in there moaning ever since.  
I don't know what I'm gonna do.  
Ah...... if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Wasn't me</span>

I don't know.

**Innkeeper**  
Wrong guy? It puts us in a bad situation. That guy's taken over the john.  
And he hasn't even paid his hotel bit yet.  
Ah...... if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?

</div>

Barret runs out of the bathroom.

**Barret**  
Yo, Cloud\! Still too early, ain't it?

Cloud shrugs, and Barret runs back into the bathroom.

**Innkeeper**  
Come on now... He's a friend of yours...... fibber.  
What now? Call it a night?  
200 gil a night.

**Cloud**  
\- Stay  
\- I've changed my mind

If Cloud chooses not to stay yet:

**Innkeeper**  
Are you sure? Please come again.

If Barret is in your party...

**Innkeeper**  
Shucks\!\! Too bad\!  
Hey\! Hey you\! Does your friend have a cute lady?  
She came in here looking for him a while ago. Shouldn't you find her?  
What are you going to do? Just forget about her and go to bed?  
200 gil a night.

**Cloud**  
\- Stay  
\- Changed my mind

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Stay</span>

**Innkeeper**  
You look like you can handle it. Well then......

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Changed my mind</span>

**Innkeeper**  
That's right. Don't worry. Please come by again.

</div>

Inside Johnny's house, Johnny is standing around nervously and someone is taking a bath in the bathroom.

**Johnny**  
What's with YOU\!\!  
Hey, is it.........you?  
We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were such a playboy.  
And a $\#&^ murderer\!\!  
Why can't I remember your name?

\* Note: Johnny's lines here are poorly translated. He should be identifying Cloud as an ex-SOLDIER and Tifa's childhood friend. Johnny himself was not in SOLDIER and does not come from Nibelheim.

**Cloud**  
\- Who are YOU?  
\- I'm Cloud, and don't forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Who are YOU?</span>

**Johnny**  
That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?  
That's okay. We'll just keep on like we don't know each other.  
I'm starting a new life in this town.  
A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my mumbling\! I sure envy you all just living outside with the sky as your ceiling.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'm Cloud, and don't forget it</span>

**Johnny**  
You think you're good enough to go around bragging about who you are?  
I don't wanna here it\! Heh, no more mumbling from me\!  
From now on, I'm starting a new life\!

</div>

**Woman in Bathroom**  
I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks lately and is pretty depressed.

**Johnny**  
Hurry up and get out of here\!  
I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life.

<span id="beach"></span>Down at the beach...

**Aeris**  
Oh\! Cloud\!\!

**Tifa**  
Look, look at that\!

**Cloud**  
Hm...?  
\- Who, Hojo...?  
\- That girl in the bikini......?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Who, Hojo...?</span>

Is that man over there, Hojo?

**Tifa**  
Go over and talk to him.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That girl in the bikini......?</span>

Not a bad view......

**Tifa**  
What're you looking at?  
That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him\!

</div>

**Tifa**  
Go over and talk to him.

**Aeris**  
I have a bad feeling about this.

**Men on the Beach**  
heh heh...... All the good ones are gone.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Tifa or Aeris are in the party...</span>

**Men on the Beach**  
What about that one? Shall we make do with her?  
But she's got a guy with her.  
No problem, I can handle him.  
Right? You thought so, too?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Tifa and Aeris are not in the party...</span>

**Men on the Beach**  
Geez\! What about those two?  
Heh heh...... I want the one on the left.  
Well then, I guess that leaves me with the one on the right.

</div>

Cloud runs over to where Hojo is lying in a lounge chair, surrounded by three women in bikinis.

**Woman**  
God\!\! What do you want?

**Cloud**  
\- I want to talk with that man  
\- Is that Hojo?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I want to talk with that man</span>

**Woman**  
(Hey, who do you think you are?)  
Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Is that Hojo?</span>

**Woman**  
(What's his problem?)  
Yes, that's right. It's the Professor\!  
Professor... someone's here to see you, sir.

</div>

**Hojo**  
I'm busy right now.

**Someone**  
......But. Too bad.

**Hojo**  
Heh heh heh...... All right. You sure are loud.  
Long time no see, Cloud.

Or, if Cloud talked to the woman in front of Hojo:

No, I remember you all now......  
Yes, yes. I remember now.  
It's been a long time, Cloud.

The others run over to join Cloud.

**Cloud**  
Hojo......

**Hojo**  
Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.

**Cloud**  
......What are you doing?

**Hojo**  
It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan.

**Cloud**  
Answer me\!

**Hojo**  
Hmm\! I believe we're both after the same goal.

**Cloud**  
You mean Sephiroth?

**Hojo**  
Did you see him?

Cloud nods.

**Hojo**  
I see...... Ha\! Ha\!

He stands up on his beach chair.

**Cloud**  
What is it?

**Hojo**  
Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis......  
Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?  
Or that you had to visit some place?......

**Cloud**  
I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at\!  
To beat him and put an end to all this\!

**Hojo**  
I see...... This could be interesting.  
Were you in SOLDIER? .......Heh heh heh\! Would you like to be my guinea pig?

Cloud reaches for his sword.

**Hojo**  
Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?

> **Barret**  
> Yo, yo\! It's a bad idea to kill him.
>
> **Aeris**  
> Cloud, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Stop, Cloud\! I know how you feel, but you mustn't.
>
> **Red XIII**  
> ...huff... puff... Stop, Cloud\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Knock it off, Cloud\! Look I don't know, but he knows a lot of stuff, right?

Red XIII collapses, and Cloud shakes his head.

**Hojo**  
Ha\! Ha\! Ha\!......

He walks to Aeris.

Say, aren't you the 'Ancient'?

**Aeris**  
I'm Aeris. The least you can do is remember my name.  
I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo...  
I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me.

**Hojo**  
Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna.  
How is she?

**Aeris**  
You didn't know\!? She died.

**Hojo**  
......I see.

**Aeris**  
Professor Hojo...  
Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?

**Hojo**  
......mumble... mumble... head west......

**Aeris**  
He's mumbling slowly... That must mean he's hiding something\!

Hojo sits down again.

**Hojo**  
..................

**Red XIII**  
Grrr, Grrr......... ...huff... puff...

**Tifa**  
Hey\! Answer us\!\!

Red XIII collapses again.

**Cloud**  
......It's no use. It's no go.

**Woman**  
He never takes off his lab coat even in this heat. I guess that's the mark of an intellectual.

**Woman 2**  
I'll interpret Professor Hojo's whispers.  
Head west, past Mt. Corel and keep going......  
Did you get that? I didn't understand it well, myself.

**Woman 3**  
I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo\!

**Man Swimming**  
Yipes\!\! Help\!\!  
...breath... breath...\! Kind of takes your breath away, don't it\!?

**Man on Beach**  
If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some "Soft".  
At least that's what they always say, don't they?  
Be prepared, and you'll never fear.  
Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch\! Pretty good, huh?

Inside Johnny's new house, Tifa is talking with him, the two of them sitting across from each other on the beds.

**Tifa**  
Oh, right\! I remember that, too.

**Johnny**  
Yeah, yeah\! And you remember the time when......?

**Tifa**  
Hee, hee, hee\!

**Johnny**  
Ha, ha, ha\!......

**Tifa**  
Ha, ha... oh stop it\! That's right. Oh really......

**Johnny**  
Yeah. Oh yeah, and then that time......

**Tifa**  
Yeah, yeah\!

Cloud enters the room, and both Tifa and Johnny turn to look at him.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, would you mind leaving us alone for the day?  
We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change.  
We'll try not to be too late.  
So please don't worry about us\!

**Cloud**  
\- Worry......?  
\- Yeah......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Worry......?</span>

I'm not worried.

**Tifa**  
You're right......

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah......</span>

Just remember we're leaving early tomorrow.

**Tifa**  
Ok, I know.

</div>

**Johnny**  
Yeah, so don't get mad or anything.

Back at the inn, Aeris is lying on one of the beds.

**Aeris**  
Whew... I don't know why I'm so tired.  
There's so many things I don't understand......  
I feel a little uneasy.  
Cloud...?  
What do you think of me?

**Cloud**  
\- I dunno  
\- Nothing much

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I dunno</span>

I don't understand anything.

**Aeris**  
......You're right.  
Even I don't understand myself.  
I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient?  
What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it?  
I don't understand it......  
Ahh...... I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this. Everything's so complicated.  
I'm going on to bed.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nothing much</span>

Sorry, but I never thought about things like that.

**Aeris**  
How could you say such a thing\! Sometimes you make me so mad\!  
Oh, I never should have brought this up\!\!  
I don't want to talk about it\!

</div>

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome\!\! What's it going to be?  
200 gil a night.

**Cloud**  
\- Stay  
\- Changed my mind.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Stay</span>

**Innkeeper**  
You must be tired.  
Tomorrow in the Costa del Sol area the weather is going to be...... sunny, again.  
Cradled by the sound of the ocean waves...... Sweet dreams...

Or, if Cloud doesn't have enough money:

Wait a minute\! There's not enough money here.

Cloud and the others spend the night.

**Innkeeper**  
Good morning. Be careful traveling.  
Your party has departed.  
Oops......  
That's bad luck......  
I mean, they have already left.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Changed my mind.</span>

**Innkeeper**  
You sure? I'll just be playing around here so drop by whenever you feel like it.

</div>

<span id="morning"></span>After spending the night...

**Butch**  
You got me there...... We just hired her part-time.  
She ran off with our money and Materia.  
I guess a situation that's too good to be true, usually is.  
Well, please feel free to browse around. Just don't mind looking at what's left.

Back at the beach...

**Woman**  
That's right\!\! It totally skipped my mind\!  
There was something I was supposed to tell you.  
That's right\! It's about that\!  
It was yesterday. A man wearing a black cloak came up from the ocean.  
I think he had tickets for the Gold Saucer... no, that wasn't it... I wonder if it was all just an illusion?

**Man on the Beach**  
Hey...... heh heh...... don't forget to talk to me, too.

**Woman 2**  
Hey\! President Rufus came here yesterday.  
He used to be the President's little boy. We nicknamed him the little Prez\!  
He didn't look much different than the surfers on the beach.

**Man Swimming**  
Eeeew\!\! Leave me alone\!  
Ublk\! Glug... glug...... You're gonna drown... I'm

**Woman 3**  
Yes, Professor Hojo. Where...?  
It looks like the Professor discovered or found a solution to something.  
You know, I wonder...... if they headed west for Mt. Corel?  
I'm getting a little sad.  
Professor Hojo looks happy like a child when he discovers something. He gets this big smile and then laughs......  
I guess we should chase after him. A vacation for two from Mt. Corel to Gold Saucer.

In Johnny's house, Johnny's sleeping, and the woman is still in the bathroom.

**Johnny**  
mumble... mumble... (Tifa, promise me you're gonna be happy.)

Cloud and the others leave Costa del Sol and make for Corel.

### Corel - Garbage Dump of a Town

#### [Corel Mountains](#mountains)

#### [North Corel](#corel)

#### [The Ropeway](#ropeway)

---

<span id="mountains"></span>Cloud the others make their way through the Corel Mountains. On the way up Mt. Corel, they run across an old man.

**Old Man**  
Whew\!\!  
Hey\!  
You're actually talking to me.

**Cloud**  
What is it?

**Old Man**  
I just passed a guy in a black cloak back there.  
I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me\!

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth...

> **Barret**  
> ............ahh.
>
> **Aeris**  
> There was a black-cloaked guy here, too?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Let's hurry on.
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Hmm...... I'm moving on ahead...
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Oh gawd, what a drag\!\!

**Old Man**  
It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.  
If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back.  
Whew\! I guess that's the fun of being on the road.

Cloud and his party continue up Mt. Corel and on past the Mako reactor. They follow the train tracks through the mountains and find the others gathered near a raised bridge.

> **Aeris**  
> Cloud\!\!  
> I was just wishing you were here\!  
> Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck.  
> Cloud should be able to do something.  
> But let's take a breather first.
>
> **Tifa**  
> OH\!\! Cloud\! That's it\!  
> We can't go on until the bridge is let down.  
> I think there's a switch in that shack over there...  
> But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat...
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Wha? Oh, it's you.  
> There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge.  
> Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.

An arrow appears, pointing to the shack and proclaiming, "The shack is here\!\! (^^);"

**Aeris**  
Come on, Cloud. Let's rest a minute.

**Cloud**  
Ok, then...  
\- PHS  
\- Let's move on\!

**Barret**  
......whew\!

**Aeris**  
I'm sure glad I'm with you, Cloud\!

**Tifa**  
I'm beat...

**Red XIII**  
What...?

**Yuffie**  
I'm pooped\!

Cloud heads for the shack. If Aeris or Tifa are not in the party, they start jumping up and down as Cloud passes on the track above.

**Aeris**  
Oh, Cloud\!\! Good Luck\!\!

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!\! Go Cloud\!\! Go\!\!

Further down, Cloud enters the tiny shack.

**Cloud**  
OW\!\! Sure is tight in here...  
Come on, Cloud, don't let it get to you. Let's see... this is it.  
Maybe if I turn this...  
...something should happen.  
\- Do it  
\- Leave it

Cloud turns the switch, and the others run across the bridge to go on ahead. Climbing up from near the shack, the party finds a bird's nest full of Phoenix Down.

> **Barret**  
> Haaeyy\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> How cute\!\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Yes\!\! ...how cute.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Yeow\! What a rock\!\!
>
> **Red XIII**  
> huff... huff...

**Cloud**  
What should we do?  
\- Take the damn treasure  
\- Leave it where it is

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Take the damn treasure</span>

Times are tough... I'm taking the treasure.

> **Barret**

Cloud and the others fight the mother Cokatolis.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received 10 "Phoenix Down"\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Leave it where it is</span>

...it's got nothing to do with us. Just forget about it.

</div>

They return to cross the bridge and move on. Inside a cave, there's a man lying in his bulldozer.

**Man**  
Hey\! How'd you ever wind up around here?  
Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you\!  
Oh boy\!\! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal mining town\!  
They say there were more jobs than you could shake a...  
Well, you get the picture\!  
Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit\! Me, my bulldozer... everything's out of work.  
Got no job... I can't even show my face. 'Bout all that's left for me is to just live in this hole all day.

<span id="corel"></span>The train tracks eventually dead-end into the camp of North Corel.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Barret is in the party...</span>

**Man**  
You, you're...  
Hey\!\! He's back\!

He runs off.

**Barret**  
Wait here...

Barret walks over to where a trio of men have gathered. One of them punches him.

**Men**  
Well, lookey here\! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.  
Those people over there, they with you?  
Well, I feel sorry for 'em\! Hangin' around a walkin' death sentence like Barret.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Barret is not in the party...</span>

Cloud and the others find him already accosted by the three men. One of them punches him.

**Men**  
Well, lookey here\! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.  
They kick you out of another town or somethin'?  
You destroy everything you touch.

</div>

**Men**  
You got a lot of balls comin' back here\!  
Look at this place\! It's all your fault North Corel turned into a garbage heap\!  
Why doncha say something\!?  
Or did ya forget what you done here already?

**Barret**  
...I'm sorry...

**Man**  
^%$\#\! You ain't even worth the effort.  
Don't waste your time talkin' to that Techno-freak\!

The three men nod and disperse. Barret walks back to the others.

**Barret**  
You heard 'em... It's my fault this town was... destroyed...

They let it be and continue through the town.

**Big Man**  
YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this\!

**Man**  
Get out of the way\!\!  
The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by collecting junk\!

Inside a tent...

**Old Man**  
The next train's coming in soon.

**Black Woman**  
Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer.  
He still can't kick his old habits from then.

Inside another tent...

**Man**  
I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and start a new life.  
If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that town across the river...

**Woman**  
Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided.  
But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.

**Kid**  
There was something glowing in that well over there.  
If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer\!

**Tool Shopkeeper**  
Please buy something\! Anything will do\!

**General Store Shopkeeper**  
What do you want?

**Cloud**  
\- Buy  
\- Listen to your story  
\- Not interested

**General Store Shopkeeper** (when asked for a story)  
Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station\!  
The Ropeway'll take you to the Gold Saucer.  
It don't mean much to us poor folks though...

**Weapon Shopkeeper**  
If you want to survive, then you're gonna need some of my weapons.

In the house made of scrap...

**Man**  
How am I supposed to continue living in a town that's lost everything...?  
To hell with the Mako reactor\!

**Woman**  
Because of them...... ugh. My husband got into that accident... He used to be such a strong man...

**Little Girl**  
Yaaay\!\! What do you wanna play?

Back outside...

**Man in Hardhat**  
I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that right?

**Cloud**  
\- I wouldn't know  
\- That's right

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I wouldn't know</span>

**Man in Hardhat**  
Really...? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That's right</span>

**Man in Hardhat**  
I guess I should get a '0' tattoo\! For a poor man like me, '0' oughtta be perfect.

</div>

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome. It's 50 gil a night. Would you like a room?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Enjoy your stay.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Please come again.

</div>

If Cloud leaves North Corel and attempts to cross the desert on foot...

**Cloud**  
We're moving\!?  
This is bad\!  
Hoo boy... There's no way we can walk across now.  
Not even a Chocobo could make it across... Isn't there a more powerful vehicle?

<span id="ropeway"></span>Cloud the others continue to the ropeway station.

**Aeris**  
Barret, what happened?

**Barret**  
Sorry.

**Cloud**  
What happened?

**Barret**  
My hometown used to be around here.

**Red XIII**  
What do you mean 'used to'?

**Barret**  
It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried... in just 4 years.

**Aeris**  
But how could those people say those terrible things?

**Barret**  
An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.

<div class="highlight">

Flashback to the town of Corel. A Shinra soldier stands guard outside the Mayor's house as townspeople hurry inside.

**Barret** (narrating)  
...My hometown, Corel's always been a coal mining town.  
It's so dusty, but calm and so poor...... a real small town, this one.  
That's the first time I ever heard the word "Mako Reactor" mentioned since that time...

Inside the house, a group of men are gathered. Scarlet and two Shinra employees stand before them.

**Village Headman**  
What are we going to do? The only one against this is Dyne...

Dyne stands up.

**Dyne**  
I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal\!  
Our coal's been protected for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it.  
We have no right to throw it all away so easily\!

**Barret**  
But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.

**Scarlet**  
Right, everything is Mako, now.  
It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed.

**Barret**  
Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.

**Dyne**  
I know how you feel\! I feel the same way too, damn it\!  
But even so, I won't give away our coal mines\!

**Village Headman**  
Dyne... you've got to understand.

**Barret** (narrating)  
That's how the Corel Reactor was built..... and completed.  
We all thought it would bring us an easier life.

The scene changes to show Corel in flames.

**Barret** (narrating)  
It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.  
Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.  
All the townspeople... All my relatives...... Everyone... everything......

</div>

**Cloud**  
Shinra troops? What for\!?

**Barret**  
There was an explosion at a reactor.  
Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.

**Tifa**  
That's so terrible\!

**Barret**  
Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I couldn't forgive myself.  
Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor...

**Tifa**  
Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.

**Barret**  
That's why... that's why I get so pissed off\!\!  
Not only did they take advantage of me...... But I lost my wife, Myrna, too...

**Station Man**  
Hey everyone\! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on\!  
Ride the Ropeway?

**Cloud**  
\- Go on  
\- Don't go on

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Go on</span>

**Cloud**  
Let's get on.

He gets on the ropeway.

**Barret**  
Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...

He follows Cloud.

**Tifa**  
I never knew. Barret never said a thing...

**Aeris**  
.........

**Red XIII**  
.........

**Yuffie**  
I'm not sympathizing with Barret\! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc. ...

She gets on, and the others watch her.

**Tifa**  
.........  
We better go on\!

She, Aeris, and Red XIII get on, and the ropeway leaves the station.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't go on</span>

**Barret**  
Dyne was my best friend. We was close ever since we was kids...

**Yuffie**  
I'm waiting inside.

She gets on the ropeway.

**Tifa**  
I never knew. Barret never said a thing...

**Aeris**  
Everything Shinra does seem to make everyone miserable...

**Red XIII**  
.........

**Barret**  
It's all my fault...

**Station Man**  
The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it.

</div>

They eventually get on the ropeway and it leaves the station.

<span id="arrival"></span>Cloud and the others take the Ropeway from North Corel up to Gold Saucer.

**Chocobo Mascot**  
Welcome to the Gold Saucer.

If Cloud attempts to enter without paying, he's stopped by the admissions lady.

**Admissions Lady**  
Please buy your ticket here.

**Admissions Lady**  
Welcome to the Gold Saucer.  
Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase a lifetime pass for 30000 gil.

**Cloud**  
\- Pay 3000 gil  
\- Pay 30000 gil  
\- Don't pay

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Pay 3000 gil</span>

**Admissions Lady**  
Thank you very much.  
If you leave Gold Saucer, your tickets become invalid.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Pay 30000 gil</span>

**Admissions Lady**  
Thank you very much.  
If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the park... as long as you don't lose it.

</div>

**Admissions Lady**  
Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must pay with GP.  
Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold Saucer.  
GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the Chocobo Races.  
Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful.  
Please enjoy yourselves.

Moving on through the entrance, they find themselves in the central hub of Gold Saucer, called the Station.

**Aeris**  
Wow\! Let's have fun\!  
I know this isn't the right time to do this.

She approaches Barret.

Hey, Barret, cheer up\!

**Barret**  
......I ain't in no cheery mood. So jes' leave me alone.

**Aeris**  
Really? That's too bad.

She runs over to Cloud and grabs his arm.

Let's go\!

**Tifa**  
....whisper... whisper... (Wasn't that a little harsh, Aeris\!?)

**Aeris**  
...whisper... whisper... (Just act normal when this happens)

**Tifa**  
...whisper... (You think so...?)

**Aeris**  
Of course\!

She runs back over to Barret.

We're gonna go play...

**Barret**  
So PLAY\! ...messin' round \#@^%$\!  
Don't forget we're after Sephiroth\!

He runs over and jumps down the tube leading to Wonder Square.

**Aeris**  
...I think he's mad.

**Tifa**  
He'll be fine. He seems to be doing a little better now.

> **Aeris**  
> I wish we could just forget everything and have fun\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> We'd better be careful, Sephiroth might be around.

> **Red XIII**  
> ......You want to go with me?

> **Yuffie**

If Cloud tries to leave the Station alone, one of them will run up to him...

<span id="explore"></span>Cloud chooses one member of the group to accompany him, and they set off to explore Gold Saucer. At Chocobo Square... A bunch of Shinra soldiers are gathered on the steps.

**Cloud**  
Sh...\!  
Shinra soldiers... Even here...

**Soldier**  
Attention\! Dismissed\!\!

The soldiers disperse to different areas of the Gold Saucer, and after a moment Cloud heads up the stairs.

**Lady at Entrance**  
Welcome to Chocobo Racing.

**Man Betting**  
I... I lost...

Or:

Yeahh\! This is why I can't seem to quit.

Or:

Go---\!\! Do it----\!\! That's it----\!\!

**Man**  
You can only buy up to 3 tickets. Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes.

**Cloud**  
\- Boxes?  
\- Not interested

**Man**  
A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 chocobos.  
For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1-3, 1-5, 3-5.  
You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo.

**Cloud**  
\- Limited wheel?  
\- Not interested

**Man**  
Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.  
For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.  
No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to insight and luck.

**Security** (near Jockey Lounge)  
I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only.

**Blond Man**  
We usually buy tickets for the B rank and C rank races, right?

**Cloud**  
\- Rank?  
\- Not interested

**Blond Man**  
In other words, 'rank' means the Chocobo's 'strength'. A is highest and C's the lowest.  
When you become a Free Chocobo jockey, you'll be able to buy A rank tickets.  
Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey\!?

**Cloud**  
\- How DO you become one?  
\- Not interested

**Blond Man**  
You can become one if you own a Chocobo... and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.

**Woman**  
Hey, what's that Chocobo on the odds sheet?

**Redhead**  
That's how you can find out a Chocobo's condition and strengths.

**Woman**  
Hmm, If you can tell which ones are the strongest, then it's easy...

**Redhead**  
Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength,  
but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.  
If these are bad, they may use too much stamina, and affect other things.

**Lady at the Ticket Desk**  
Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Ask how to buy  
\- Explain it to me  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Lady at the Ticket Desk**  
Registration fees are 200 gil. Is that all right?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeahhh\!  
\- No way\!

**Lady at the Ticket Desk**  
Which rank would you like to select?

**Cloud**  
\- C (1BET 1 0 0 gil)  
\- B (1BET 2 0 0 gil)  
\- Quit

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Ask how to buy</span>

**Lady at the Ticket Desk**  
You are allowed a maximum of 3 bets on your Chocobo ticket.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Explain it to me</span>

**Lady at the Ticket Desk**  
This Chocobo Race has Virtual devices on the course.  
They show natural scenery during the race that really doesn't exist.  
You pick which Chocobo will finish first and second here,  
And then buy the appropriate tickets.  
And if the ticket you purchased is a winner, you'll receive a ticket for an item that will be listed on the panel.  
You can exchange your tickets for items or GP at the Exchange counter to the right of the entrance.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

At Battle Square, there is a staff woman standing in front of the stairs.

**Woman**  
I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again.

At Ghost Square, a zombie greets Cloud as he enters the hotel.

**Zombie**  
Welcome. Thank you for coming to the Ghost Hotel.  
Uuuuuuuuuuugh......  
For reservations, please step up to the counter.  
Uuuuuuuuuuugh......

Cloud steps up to the counter, and a man in a noose drops down with a scream.

**Receptionist**  
It's our most popular employee, Mr. Hangman.

**Mr. Hangman**  
Welcome\!

**Receptionist**  
It's 5 GP a night. Would you like to stay?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, all right  
\- No thanks

**Receptionist**  
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh\! Enjoy, ugh, your stay.

**Flyer**  
\[Turtle's Paradise\]  
No. 3  
Forget the bad times with a nice drink...  
Only thing missing in Gold Saucer is......  
A pub with good drinks and a great atmosphere\!  
Stop in the "Turtle's Paradise"\!

If Cloud attempts to go upstairs without paying...

**Mr. Hangman**  
Sir... Please register at the counter\!\!

At Round Square...

**Woman at Ticket Booth**  
Welcome. This attraction is 3 GP.  
Shall you be riding this evening?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes, I shall  
\- No, I shan't

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes, I shall</span>

**Woman at Ticket Booth**  
Would this be your first time riding with us?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes, it would  
\- No, it would not

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes, it would</span>

**Woman at Ticket Booth**  
You will be able to see all the different areas of Gold Saucer on this ride.  
So please just sit back and enjoy a lovely view you won't see anywhere else.  
This attraction can only ccommodate 2 passengers, so one of you please wait over there.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Who should I ride with...

Cloud selects a companion.

**Woman at Ticket Booth**  
Enjoy the sights of Gold Saucer.

Cloud and his companion ride the gondola.

<span class="highlight">If Cloud does not have enough GP to pay.</span>

**Woman at Ticket Booth**  
Um, I'm very sorry, but you do not have enough GP.

</div>

At Speed Square, a muscular man addresses Cloud when he arrives.

**Man**  
Hey boy.

**Cloud**  
Boy...

**Man**  
How is it? You having fun?  
Mmm, so, you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy.

**Cloud**  
My name's Cloud. And stop calling me boy.

**Dio**  
Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio.  
Just call me 'Dio'.

**Cloud**  
...... (Not even listening)

**Dio**  
By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?

**Cloud**  
\- I know what it is  
\- What is it?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I know what it is</span>

**Dio**  
Oh, so you do know.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What is it?</span>

**Dio**  
Ha ha ha...... that, I say, that's a good one, boy\! But it's not good to lie. You can't fool me.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Why d'you ask me?

**Dio**  
Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had a 'Black Materia.'  
I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age.

**Cloud**  
Did he happen to have... a Black Cape...

**Dio**  
Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.

**Cloud**  
Where did he go\!?

**Dio**  
Ha ha ha, I have no idea.  
Well then.  
I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy.  
You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display there.  
Ha, ha ha.

He leaves.

**Person**  
We have to be careful of these steps.  
What...? A lot of things...

**Redhead**  
First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess on the attacks...... mumble, mumble......

Onward to the roller coaster. If Cloud tries to get on without buying a ticket...

**Ticket Person**  
This way, Sir, to register.

**Ticket Person**  
Is this your first time? First, listen to the explanation of the game over there.

**Lady**  
Hear the rules for this attraction?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- Not interested

**Lady**  
This attraction, Shooting Coaster is  
While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things are going PHEW PHEW and you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, isn't it?  
Oh, to shoot, hit the O Button. And, the Bar that's shown on the left side of the screen is the Power Meter.  
When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll only go BRM and become weak. So be careful.  
Also, if you're in the Top 3 you'll get on the Wall of Fame.

**Ticket Person**  
This attraction costs 10 GP.

**Cloud**  
\- Pay  
\- Changed my mind

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud does not have enough GP to pay.</span>

**Ticket Person**  
......... You don't have enough GP

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Otherwise</span>

**Ticket Person**  
Thank you.

</div>

Cloud and the others ride the coaster.

**Wall of Fame Staffer**  
Your score is x points.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud scored 3000-4999 points...</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

As a price, Received "Super Sweeper/Masamune Blade/1/35 soldier"\!\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud scored 5000+ points...</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

As a price, Received "Umbrella"\!\!

</div>

</div>

Sometimes after coming off the roller coaster, Cloud will walk to the side and hang his head.

**Cloud**  
Ugh...

**Wall of Fame Staffer**  
Would you like to see the Wall of Fame?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- Not interested

Cloud's current 3 high scores are displayed.

**Wall of Fame Staffer**  
You'll receive a prize if you get more than 3000 Points. So good luck.

Stepping back into the hallway, Cloud may encounter a couple standing there.

**Man**  
Hey, I finally got 5000 points.

**Woman**  
Wow\!\! You're so wonderful\!\!

**Man**  
Man, I finally got a prize...

The next time Cloud sees the couple...

**Man**  
Hey, I got 5000 points again.

**Woman**  
Wow\!\! You're so wonderful\!\!

**Man**  
Well, I guess I'll go and get some more GP.

Sometimes a pair of children will appear running towards the coaster.

**Little Girl**  
Eyyaaaaaa\!

**Little Boy**  
Yaaay----\!\!

**Man**  
Come on now, no running.

At Event Square, the stands are empty except for some staff members and two couples sitting around.

**Security**  
Sorry but there's no show now.

**Staffer**  
We put on a really unusual show here. It's not on today, but come back again sometime and see it.

**Couple**  
What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?

**Couple 2**  
Geez, you're a real bummer. Why don't you just leave us alone?

<span id="cait"></span>At Wonder Square, Cloud and his companion are approached by a black cat toy riding a giant stuffed moogle.

**Cait Sith**  
Hey you\!\! What're you lookin' so down for\!?  
How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune\!? A bright future\! A happy future\!  
Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction\!  
Oh, so sorry\! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's...  
Cait Sith.

**Cloud**  
You can only read the future?

**Cait Sith**  
You kidding\!? I can find missing things, missing people, anything\!

**Cloud**  
Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?

**Cait Sith**  
Sephiroth, right\!?  
Okay, here goes\!\!

He shakes about on his moogle, and it then hands Cloud a fortune.

**Cloud**  
...Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune.  
Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen after summer. ...wait... what's this?

**Cait Sith**  
Huh? Let me try again.

**Cloud**  
Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is... blue?  
...Forget it.

**Cait Sith**  
Wait, wait give me another chance\!  
Wait\! Let me try it again\!

**Cloud**  
...What the\!?

**Cloud**  
What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear.

**Cait Sith**  
I don't know if it's good OR bad...  
This's the first time I ever got something like THIS.  
Then shall we?

**Cait Sith**  
As a fortune teller, I can't help but think about this.  
If I don't see what it leads to, I won't be able to relax. That's why I'm going with you\!

**Cloud**  
H... hey\!

**Man in Overalls**  
They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'.  
They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square games or at the Chocobo Races.

**Chocobo Mascots**  
Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have some fun\!  
Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have a blast\!

**People Playing Wonder Catcher**  
All...... most......  
Crap\!  
no cigar...  
You sure do need a lot of money here.  
Please...... don't...... talk to me...... right now.  
I get so caught up in these......  
Back there...

**Guy on Motorcycle Game**  
Hyuuuuu, BAM, BAM, BAM...  
Oh man, I just gotta shout.

**Guy on Snowboard Game**  
Nope, I'm not quitting until I clear this\!  
I'm gonna be the wind again today\!

**Guy Near Submarine Game**  
Whew, I'm tired. Oh this? It seems to be out of order.

**Guy Near Mog Game**  
...... Don't worry 'bout me. Go ahead and play.

Cloud plays Mog House.

**Narration**  
This is Mog's house. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog.  
The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog.  
This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. ...that's 28 in human years. He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate.  
But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how to fly.  
Even though Mog trains hard everyday... He still can't seem to get off the ground...

Mog tries to fly and falls on his face.

**Narration**  
Looks like he's still got a long way to go...  
Here's where you come in. Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing O button and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.  
But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat.

Cloud feeds Mog Kupo nuts, and he hops up again.

**Narration**  
Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud fed him the wrong number of nuts...</span>

He falls flat on his face again.

**Narration**  
Poor Mog. It looks like he'll have to wait some time for a mate.  
Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud fed him the right number of nuts...</span>

Mog takes off and makes a few circuits around the screen.

**Narration**  
He did it\! He's flying\! Now, he's finally become a full-fledged Mog.

Mog lands and returns to his house, taking a bow before going inside.

**Narration**  
Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Good night, and sweet dreams......

A pink moogle appears.

**Narration**  
Oh?... What's this? Here comes a female Mog\!

She approaches Mog's house and knocks. Mog comes out and chirps.

**Narration**  
Seems he likes her too...  
Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her? Help him out with a few kupo nuts.

Cloud feeds Mog Kupo nuts, and he hops up again.

**Narration**  
Oh? It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud fed Mog the wrong number of nuts...</span>

He falls on his face again.

**Narration**  
Unfortunately, he didn't make it. Poor Mog'll have to wait some time for a bride.  
Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud fed him the right number of nuts...</span>

Mog takes off and makes a few circuits around the screen.

**Narration**  
He's flying\!\! Mog was able to do it\!  
She must have fallen for his graceful flying form.

The screen goes dark.

Sometime later...

Mog steps out of his house.

**Narration**  
Looks like things are going good with his new Mog-friend. Time for a quiet date in the forest.  
Her name is Mag. She is a good-natured Mog.

Mog and Mag leave the house and walk off screen.

**Narration**  
Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag. May you have lots and lots of healthy Mogs\!

No fewer than 12 baby moogles exit the house. The last one trips and falls on his face. One of the others comes back for him and they run off.

**Narration**  
Uh...no worries there, I guess...

\~FIN\~

The game ends.

**Guy Near Mog Game**  
Hmm... I'm impressed... Thanks for showing me it.  
Here, take this.

**Cloud**  
\- Try it

**Fortune Telling Machine**  
Use caution in relationships

If Cloud tries to leave Gold Saucer via the Ropeway...

> **Aeris**  
> Are you thinking of just us going back?

> **Tifa**  
> Hey, Cloud, Are we going back without the others?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Are we leaving the others?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Cloud\! Are we just going to leave the others?

<span id="battle"></span>Returning to Battle Square, Cloud and the others arrive to find a Shinra soldier standing in front of the stairs.

**Cloud**  
\!\!

The soldier collapses, and Cloud goes over to investigate.

**Cloud**  
Mm\!?  
Dead......

> **Aeris**  
> What\!? Why?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What\!?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> What the...

> **Yuffie**

Cloud runs off up the stairs.

> Cloud\!? Where are you going?

> **Tifa**  
> Wa... wait Cloud\!
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Hey, Cloud\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Don't, don't just leave me\!

The others follow him up to the battle arena, where four more soldiers lie dead, and the staff members are slumped at their counters.

**Cloud**  
Did Sephiroth do this\!?  
No... it's not him... They're all shot... Sephiroth would never use a gun...

One of the Gold Saucer staffers stirs.

**Woman**  
Ugh, ugggh.

Cloud and the others run over to her.

**Cloud**  
Hey, what happened\!

**Woman**  
Ugh... ugh... a man with a gun... on his arm......

> **Aeris**  
> It can't be\!?

**Security**  
Hold it right there\! And stay quiet\!\!

Dio enters with two security guards.

**Dio**  
Did you guys do this\!?

**Cloud**  
N... no, it wasn't us\!

**Dio** (if you spoke earlier)  
I must've been wrong...

**Cait Sith**  
Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly.

He runs for the arena.

**Cloud**  
He...... hey\!

**Dio**  
Hold them\!\!

Cloud follows Cait Sith into the arena.

**Dio**  
That's as far as you go.

**Cloud**  
Wait, listen to...

**Cait Sith**  
Cloud...

Robots approach them from three sides, and Dio blocks the way back out... The scene changes to where Cloud is being held by one of the robots. Before him is a hatch labeled "Gateway to heaven."

**Dio**  
One more to go.

**Security**  
Yes

**Cloud**  
Hey\! Pay attention\!\!

**Dio**  
There's no need to listen. Pay for your crime down below\!\!  
Do it\!

**Security**  
Yes

The hatch opens, and the robot jumps in, carrying Cloud with it.

<span id="arrival"></span>Cloud lands in the prison town below Gold Saucer.

> **Aeris**  
> You all right?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Cloud, you all right?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Are you all right?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Hey, you okay?

**Cloud**  
Where are we?

**Cait Sith**  
A desert prison... Corel Prison...

**Cloud**  
A desert prison?

**Cait Sith**  
Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert... surrounded entirely by quicksand.  
I heard that once you get in, you never get out...  
But, there was one special exception...

The third party member turns around suddenly to notice Barret a ways off.

> **Aeris**  
> Hey\!\! Barret\!\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Barret\!?
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Mmm\!? Isn't that Barret?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Hey? Isn't that guy, Barret?

They all run over to Barret. Near him is a corpse.

**Cloud**  
Barret...  
Did he really......

**Barret**  
Stay back\! This's something I gotta deal with.  
Jes' leave me alone...

He runs off.

**Cait Sith**  
Whew\! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous...

> **Aeris**  
> Cloud, what should we do? Barret's not his normal self.
>
> **Tifa**  
> ...Barret......
>
> **Red XIII**  
> Barret...
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Hey, Cloud\! Just leave him alone.  
> I mean, he told us to, didn't he? Then that's that, right?

Cloud kneels down by the corpse.

**Cloud**  
This one's been shot too...

**Man Near Gate**  
Wo-ho\! Welcome to Corel Prison.  
Hold---it. If you wanna pass, Then you're gonna need the boss's permission.

If Cloud tries to run out into the desert...

**Cloud**  
We should find Barret before we go out into the desert.

Cloud and the others follow Barret. A man starts following them.

**Man Following**  
Ha ha ha

**Man**  
I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely dangerous.  
It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave it, it'll swallow ya.  
I hear tell, some of them never make it out... the best thing is to stay out of the desert entirely.

**Black Man**  
Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not a one of 'em will tell you the truth.  
Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of them.

**Three Liars**  
This place is heaven.  
This place is heaven.  
This place is heaven.  
Man with a gun on his arm?  
Never heard of him.  
Never heard of him.  
Never heard of him.  
You wanna see the Boss?  
Go Southwest and you'll meet him.  
You'll meet him.  
You'll meet him.  
Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk.  
Don't walk  
Don't walk  
There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. No way.  
No way.  
No way.

**Man 2**  
This elevator will take you to the top...  
But, you gotta be picked as a Chocobo Racer, first.

**Big Man**  
Want to enter the Chocobo Race?

**Cloud**  
\- Not interested  
\- Yeah, I want to enter

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Big Man**  
You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, I want to enter</span>

**Big Man**  
Then go get permission with the boss of this place.

**Cloud**  
Who's the boss?

**Big Man**  
You don't even know that? Oh man.

</div>

**Guards Outside Trailer**  
You new? Then go and pay your respects to Mr. Coates.

Inside the trailer...

**Mr. Coates**  
Never seen your face 'round here before. Goin' up?

**Cloud**  
\- Not interested  
\- Yeah, up

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Mr. Coates**  
Heh heh\! You sure got guts\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, up</span>

**Mr. Coates**  
You don't seem to understand how things work down here.  
This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya scrubs.  
The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race.  
But, it's not as easy as you rookies think.  
Of course, if you got the boss's permission it'd be a different story but, YOU'll never get that\!  
Ha ha ha ha.

</div>

At the prison pub...

**Shopkeeper**  
A rookie? Then you gotta buy something. Yup, that's the rule here.

<span id="barret"></span>Finally, Cloud, Cait Sith, and the third party member enter the mayor's old house. Barret bursts in after them.

**Barret**  
Didn't I tell you not to come here\!?

He aims his gun arm in their direction.

**Cait Sith**  
Ju...... just hold on for a second\! We just want to talk\! You'll understand if you just hear us out\!

Barret fires, and a man behind the couch collapses.

**Barret**  
Didn't want none of ya to get involved...

Cloud shrugs, and the others run in.

**Aeris**  
Hey that's Cloud's line\! '...It's too dangerous, I can't let you get involved...' blah, blah, blah...

**Tifa**  
Yeah. We're already involved in this.

**Aeris**  
We saw you and hurried here. Barret, just tell us what's going on.

**Barret**  
You guys...

**Red XIII**  
I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a gun-arm. ...Was that you?

Barret shakes his head violently.

**Barret**  
There's another... another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago...

<div class="highlight">

Flashback. Barret and Dyne are walking along the train tracks that lead to North Corel.

**Barret** (narrating)  
I remember... I was on my way home from visiting a Mako Reactor being built.

**Village Headman**  
Barret\! Dyne\! Come quick\! The village's being attacked\! It's Shinra soldiers\!

**Barret**  
What\!\!\!?

Barret and Dyne turn to one another and nod. They run to an overlook where they can see the village burning.

**Barret**  
What the hell happened?......

**Dyne**  
Hey, Barret\! It's not over yet\!  
Everyone's waiting\! Let's go back to the village\!

They start back towards the village.

**Village Headman**  
Barret\! Dyne\! Protect the village...\!

Shinra soldiers enter and shoot the village headman.

**Barret**  
Hmp\!\! Old man\!\!

Barret and Dyne make a run for it, and the soldiers start shooting at them.

**Dyne**  
C'mon, Barret\! We gotta hurry\!

Dyne runs ahead.

**Barret**  
Krggh\!\!

Barret runs after him.

**Dyne**  
Barret\!\! You stay here\!\!

**Barret**  
Shu'up\!\!

**Scarlet**  
Kyaa haa, ha\!\!  
You can shoot all day and never hit them with aim like that.

Scarlet punches one of the soldiers off the bridge, and the others hold their hands up.

**Scarlet**  
Haa, ha, ha\!\! Stop playing around and cover me\!\!

**Dyne**  
Watch out\!\!

Dyne jumps in front of Barret, gets shot, and falls over the edge of the cliff. Barret catches his hand.

**Barret**  
Dyne\!\! Hang on\!\!  
Lissen to me\!\! You're comin' back to the village, hear\!\!?

**Dyne**  
Yeah... I ain't lettin' go...  
You're comin' back... Everyone's waitin' for ya...  
Eleanor... and Marlene... They all waitin' on us...

The spray of bullets crosses their joined hands, and Barret loses his grip. Dyne falls into the ravine.

</div>

**Barret**  
From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more.  
...I was depressed for a while.  
But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in.  
Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away...  
Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me.  
But, his was the left arm.

**Cloud**  
......

**Aeris**  
But... Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?

**Tifa**  
Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too.  
He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.

**Barret**  
...wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace.  
An' that's why, I gotta go alone.

**Cloud**  
Do whatever you want... Is that what you want to hear?  
Well, I can't let you do it. Because, if you die on me, I'm gonna have nightmares.

**Aeris**  
Barret, this isn't the end.

**Tifa**  
Weren't you going to save the Planet?

**Barret**  
Shit\! Tifa, you oughtta know by now.

**Tifa**  
...That's all right. I'm not so different from you.

**Aeris**  
That's easier to understand. It's you, Barret.

**Cloud**  
So there it is, Barret. So I guess it'll be Barret, me, and......

**Aeris**  
I wonder if Dyne will join us?

**Tifa**  
Be careful.

**Red XIII**  
Hmm? Shall I go with you?

**Yuffie**  
You sure are all acting pretty heroic, considerin' we're not makin' any money on this...

**Cait Sith**  
Fortune's good. Everything is perfect\!

Cloud and the others go back to the north gate to find the man there dead.

**Cloud**  
This one's been shot too...

They head out into the desert.

**Man**  
Man, the Boss was REALLY in a bad mood today... Or was it one of his better days?  
If you get lost in the desert, just keep going Northeast. If you're lucky, you'll make it back here.

If Cloud gets himself lost in the desert, eventually a mysterious chocobo carriage will appear.

**Carriage Driver**  
Wanna ride...?

**Cloud**  
\- Get on  
\- Don't get on

<span id="dyne"></span>Going northeast, they come across a junkyard, and beyond it they find the ruins of a house and two crude grave markers on the edge of a ravine. Dyne is slumped there. Barret steps forward, gesturing for the others to stay back.

**Barret**  
...Dyne ...Is that you?

**Dyne**  
Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years...  
A voice I'll never forget...

He limps forward.

**Barret**  
I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday...  
I knew you were alive somewhere... we had the same operation.  
Listen to me Dyne. I want to...

He starts forward, but Dyne fires at his feet, and Barret stops.

**Dyne**  
What's that? ......I hear her voice.

**Barret**  
......?

**Dyne**  
I hear her voice, Eleanor's voice. Begging me... not to hate your rotten guts.  
That's why I didn't hunt you down...

**Barret**  
...I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me.  
But... What're you doin' in a place like this?  
Why ya wanna kill those that ain't even involved? Why?

**Dyne**  
...Why\!? The hell do you care for\!?  
Are the people killed going to understand 'why'? Are the people of Corel going to understand just hearing Shinra's excuses?  
I don't CARE what the reason is\!  
All they give us are artillery and stupid excuses... What's left is a world of despair and emptiness...

**Barret**  
......

**Dyne**  
You still want to hear 'why'? ...All right, I'll tell you.  
'Cause I want to destroy everything.

He punctuates his next statements with gunshots.

The people of this city.  
This city itself.  
The whole world\!

He turns away.

I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor...... Marlene......

**Barret**  
Dyne, Marlene...... Marlene's still alive.

**Dyne**  
......?

**Barret**  
I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure.  
That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end.  
That's when I found her... ...found Marlene.

**Dyne**  
...

**Barret**  
She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?

**Dyne**  
So...... she's still alive...  
All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight.

**Barret**  
What\!?

**Dyne**  
Eleanor's alone all by herself. I've got to take Marlene to her.

**Barret**  
Dyne... are you insane\!?

**Dyne**  
Marlene wants to see her Mom, don't she?

He starts firing at Barret.

**Barret**  
Stop, Dyne\! I can't die yet\!

**Dyne**  
Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.

**Barret**  
Stop it\! I don't wanna fight you\!

**Cloud**  
Barret\!

**Barret**  
Cloud, you stay the hell out of it\! This is MY problem\!\!

Barret fights and defeats Dyne, who falls to his knees.

**Dyne**  
Urgh\!

He starts to get back up.

Back\!\!

He limps away to lean against a wall.

...it wasn't just my arm...... back then......  
I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where I went wrong...

**Barret**  
Dyne... I don't know either, man.  
Is this the only way... we can resolve this?

**Dyne**  
I told you... I... I want to destroy everything...  
Everything... This crazy world... Even me...

**Barret**  
An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her\!?

**Dyne**  
...Think about it... Barret... How old was Marlene back then...?  
Even if I did go to her now... she wouldn't even know me...  
And what's more... Barret...  
These hands are a little too stained to carry Marlene anymore...

**Barret**  
......

**Dyne**  
Barret...

He pulls a necklace off and tosses it to Barret.

Give that pendant to Marlene... It was... Eleanor's... my wife's... memento...

**Barret**  
All right...

**Dyne**  
...wow... Marlene's... already...... 4......

He limps to the edge of the ravine.

Barret... Don't...... make... ......Don't ever make Marlene...... cry...

**Barret**  
Dyne...?  
Dyne\!

Dyne lets himself fall backwards over the edge as Barret runs towards him.

**Barret**  
Dy------ne\!\!

He falls to his knees.

...Dyne. Me an' you were the same...  
My hands ain't any cleaner...... I shouldn't be able to carry... Marlene either...  
Uuuurrrrrrgh\!\!\!

<span id="up"></span>Back at the trailer...

**Mr. Coates**  
You want somethin'?

**Barret**  
I want to go up.

**Mr. Coates**  
Like I told you before, you gotta get the Boss' permission, then win the Chocobo......

**Barret**  
Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak.

He pulls out the necklace.

So, I got this, instead.

**Mr. Coates**  
Yeah, bull--\!\!

**Barret**  
I want to go up.

**Mr. Coates**  
R, right.  
Did you kill Dyne?  
You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing.  
...So Dyne's dead... Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little.  
Dyne didn't care who anyone was......

Barret grabs Mr. Coates by the collar.

**Barret**  
The hell do YOU know\!\!

**Mr. Coates**  
R... ri...... right\! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. S, s... sorry.

Barret releases him.

**Cloud**  
Then, will you get us outta here?

**Mr. Coates**  
Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken.  
I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here.  
That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer.  
And, only one racer can go up at a time.

**Barret**  
Say what\!?

**Mr. Coates**  
Noooo\! Really, even if you threaten me\!\!  
A rule's a rule. I can't change it.  
If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up\!\! An' I can't do that\!  
Okay, ok, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio.

**Barret**  
Awright then.  
Cloud, you go.  
We'll wait down here.  
Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here\!

> **Aeris**  
> Yes, good luck, Cloud.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Right, Cloud. We'll be waiting and rooting for you.
>
> **Red XIII**  
> You're right. Cloud should do it.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Well, Cloud go get 'em\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Ok Cloud, knock 'em dead\!

Cloud shrugs.

**Mr. Coates**  
Have you decided?  
All you need now is a manager.  
...and register and get a Chocobo...

**Ester**  
Hi...... I happened to hear your story.

**Mr. Coates**  
Ester?

A girl walks in, wearing a pink dress and a chocobo feather in her hair.

**Ester**  
I'll be your manager.

**Mr. Coates**  
Well, I have nothing against it, but...  
This is Ester. She may look kinda funny...  
But there's no better manager in the races...

**Ester**  
That's so rude...  
Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, Cloud.

**Mr. Coates**  
All right then, Cloud.  
I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details.

On the elevator...

**Ester**  
Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. You just concentrate on the race.  
Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals.  
Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some for glory... And then there're people like you.  
Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo.

**Cloud**  
\- All right  
\- Not interested

**Ester**  
Ummm... First use the \[Select\] button to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.  
In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own.  
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.  
You can't really help on this one.  
But, most of the Chocobo's that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them.  
When you're riding, use the \[\] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down.  
But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast.  
And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed.  
Of course your stamina runs out faster though.  
There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.  
For these kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.  
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,  
Push the \[Start\] button to end the race.

The elevator reaches the top, and Cloud steps out.

**Man**  
You new?

**Ester**  
Hi, Joe.

**Joe**  
Hey, Ester you're looking pretty as usual.

**Ester**  
Thanks.  
Let me introduce you, Cloud.  
This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys.

**Joe**  
Nice to meet you, Cloud.  
If you're with Ester, then...

**Ester**  
Right\! He's an up and coming jockey.  
He's only been down here for a day and already he made it up here\!\!

**Joe**  
What\!?  
Oh, I see...  
So what did you do down there?  
Sorry... you're not supposed to ask about the past here...  
Pretty interesting... I have a feeling that we'll meet again.  
Then, until we meet again, Cloud.

He leaves the room.

**Ester**  
I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a while.  
I'll be right back.

**Jockeys**  
......  
I got nothing to say.  
......  
Don't get cocky. Skills don't matter once you get in the race...

<div class="highlight">

The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the next race, please proceed to the paddock.  
I repeat...

</div>

All the jockeys leave, but Cloud stays behind. Eventually Ester returns.

**Ester**  
Cloud  
Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race.  
This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He won't lose easily.  
Oh yeah... You know how to ride one?

**Cloud**  
\- Uh, how was it again?  
\- Yeah, I got it

**Ester**  
Then, good luck.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud loses the race...</span>

**Ester**  
Too bad.

If Cloud comes in 4th place or worse:

You had a tough situation there.

If Cloud comes in 3rd place:

I was expecting a little more from you.

If Cloud comes in 2nd place:

You were so close.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If it is Cloud's 1st or 2nd loss...</span>

**Ester**  
Let me find a better Chocobo for you. Wait here for a while, OK?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud has lost 3 times...</span>

**Ester**  
If you couldn't win with that last Chocobo...  
All right, I'll go get the best Chocobo there is\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud has lost 4 or more times...</span>

**Ester**  
You gotta be kidding me\!? There aren't any other Chocobos better than the last one\!  
Well, if you really want to win, just push the 'SELECT'  
and try the 'AUTO' mode.

</div>

</div>

Eventually Cloud wins a race.

**Ester**  
Congratulations\!\! Now you're home free\!  
Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you when you won.

**Dio**  
Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must've won. And won a victory that I am sure you earned.  
I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you are victorious, I promise that you and all your friends will get a full pardon, and you all will be set free.  
And also, by way of apology, I prepared a little gift for you to use on your journey.  
Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a very busy man.  
Sincerely, Dio

**Cloud**  
A gift?

His PHS rings, and he answers it.

<div class="highlight">

**Aeris**  
Cloud, isn't this great\!? The assistant manager just stopped by and dropped off a 'buggy' for you\!  
Now you can go over 'deserts' and 'rivers' no problem.  
OK, Cloud. I'll be waiting outside.

</div>

**Cloud**  
(Hmm? The letter continues...)  
P.S. I just recently met Sephiroth. He must have a lot of fans with boys your age.  
Why don't you get his autograph? It seems he's headed toward the South of the river, towards Gongaga.  
Sephiroth...

**Ester**  
I guess this is goodbye.  
Yeah. Well, if you ever get your own Race Chocobo, come back again.  
I'll take care of your registration and everything. I'll see you again.

Cloud and the others leave via their new buggy, headed South towards Gongaga.

<span id="turks"></span>Cloud enters the forest surrounding Gongaga.

**\* Note**: Because the party can trigger these events by visiting Gongaga any time before getting the Keystone, Vincent and Cid's responses are included here as well. Red XIII also has slightly different dialogue after completing the events at Cosmo Canyon.

**Cloud**  
...Is someone there?

Farther along the path, Reno and Rude stand talking.

**Reno**  
Hey, Rude. Who do you like?

Rude turns away.

**Reno**  
What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?

**Rude**  
.........Tifa.

**Reno**  
Hmmmm...  
That's a tough one.  
But, poor Elena. She...... you......

**Rude**  
No, she likes Tseng.

**Reno**  
I never knew that\! But Tseng likes that Ancient...

**Cloud**  
What are they talking about?

Elena comes up from behind him, and he turns around in surprise.

**Elena**  
It's so stupid\!  
They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.  
Ah\! Oh no\!

She runs past Cloud to join Reno and Rude.

They're here\! They're really here\!

**Reno**  
Hmm... Then it's time...  
Rude... Don't go easy on them even though they're girls.

**Rude**  
...Don't worry, I'll do my job.

**Elena**  
Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng\!

She runs off down the right fork of the path.

**Reno**  
It's been a while.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If coming any time before the Wutai sidequest...</span>

**Reno**  
Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.

**Cloud**  
\- Sector 7?  
\- Out of our way

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Sector 7?</span>

**Reno**  
That's sad.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Out of out way</span>

**Reno**  
I don't like being taken for a fool.

</div>

</div>

**Rude**  
That's as far as you go.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If coming after encountering the Turks in Wutai...</span>

**Reno**  
This is just part of the job. Don't take it personally.

</div>

Cloud and the others fight and defeat Reno and Rude.

**Reno**  
We may be retreating, but...  
we're still victorious\!

**Rude**  
...............

Rude and Reno each check their watches and run off.

> **Barret**  
> I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?

> **Aeris**  
> ...How could they know we were coming here.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hey, something seems wrong, Like they knew we were coming.

> **Red XIII**  
> Interesting... They were definitely waiting for us.

> Or, after Cosmo Canyon:

> Hey, Cloud. How did the Turks know to wait and ambush us here?

>
> **Cid**  
> Man, looks like they've taken a short cut.

**Cloud**  
They followed us...... But there weren't any signs of it. Then, that means......

> **Barret**  
> A spy, maybe? No, no way.
>
> **Aeris**  
> That there's a Shinra spy...
>
> **Tifa**  
> A spy\!?...No way.

>
> **Vincent**

>
> **Cid**  
> And a couple of Shinra dogs are here too\!

**Cloud**  
I don't even want to think that there's a spy...  
I trust everyone.

<span id="reactor"></span>The right fork of the path leads to the ruins of a Mako reactor.

**Cloud**  
A ruined reactor.

A helicopter lands outside the reactor, and Scarlet and Tseng get off.

**Cloud**  
It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development.

He runs and hides in the rubble. Scarlet enters the reactor, Tseng following.

**Scarlet**  
......Hmph\! This isn't any good either.  
You only get junky materia from junky reactors.  
This reactor's a failure.  
What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?

**Tseng**  
...No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.

**Scarlet**  
Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.

**Tseng**  
I just can't wait.

**Scarlet**  
With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been betting a bigger budget.

**Tseng**  
I envy them.

**Scarlet**  
But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid Heidegger even use it?

**Tseng**  
......

**Scarlet**  
Oh... sorry\! I forgot Heidegger was your boss\! Ha ha ha\!

**Tseng**  
......

**Scarlet**  
Let's go\!

She walks back towards the helicopter, and Tseng follows.

**Cloud**  
...Big, large, huge materia?  
An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?  
Just what are the Shinra up to...?

He waits for the helicopter to leave before getting out of his hiding place. He inspects the rubble.

There's something shiny back there...  
\- Don't do anything  
\- Reach for it

<div class="highlight">

Received "Titan" Materia\!

</div>

<span id="village"></span>Cloud goes back and takes the left fork, which leads to the village. Along the path there, there is a cemetery.

**Old Man**  
............  
No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back...

**Redhead**  
Three years ago when the reactor exploded, my husband...  
Do people really need reactors to live?  
Aren't there more important things in life...?

Cloud enters the village and looks beyond to the reactor in the distance.

**Cloud**  
A ruined reactor.

Inside the weapons shop...

**Accessory Shopkeeper**  
Huh...... did you want something?

**Cloud**  
\- Buy accessories?  
\- Hear a story?  
\- Nothing in particular

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Buy accessories?</span>

The shop menu opens.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Hear a story?</span>

**Accessory Shopkeeper**  
We voted to outlaw the use of Mako energy and live with nature, ever since the explosion.  
People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nothing in particular</span>

**Accessory Shopkeeper**  
They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to get there.

</div>

Up the pole...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
...You want something?

**Cloud**  
\- Hear a story?

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...  
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.  
It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find pieces of it left all over town.

In the Item Shop...

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Oh... you here to shop?

**Cloud**  
\- Hear a story?

**Item Shopkeeper**  
One day, there was a huge explosion. Many townspeople died in it...  
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.

At the inn...

**Innkeeper**  
Uh... need somethin'?

**Cloud**  
\- Need a room?  
\- Hear a story?  
\- Nothing in particular

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Need a room?</span>

**Innkeeper**  
It's 80 Gil a night.

</div>

At the Mayor's house...

**Mayor**  
This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor explosion.  
The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the Reactor was built. But, all it brought us was sadness......

<span id="zack"></span>The party enters the house of an older couple, Zack's parents.

**Zack's Father**  
You a traveller? Hey wait, that glare in your eye... you in SOLDIER?

**Zack's Mother**  
Oh you're right\! Don't you know anything about our son?

**Zack's Father**  
His name is Zack.

**Zack's Mother**  
It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying that he didn't want to live in the country...

**Zack's Father**  
He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If neither Aeris nor Tifa are in the party...</span>

**Cloud**  
Hmmm... I don't know.

He turns for the door.

...Zack.  
Zack. I don't know anything about that man.  
......But That name sounds familiar...  
Why...\!?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If both Aeris and Tifa are in the party...</span>

**Cloud**  
Hmmm... I don't know.

**Aeris**  
Zack...

**Zack's Father**  
Young lady, you know him?

**Zack's Mother**  
I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?

**Aeris**  
That can't...

She leaves the house.

**Tifa**  
Zack...

She follows.

**Cloud**  
What happened to you two?

He goes outside.

\[[Cloud talks to Aeris.](#aeris)\]

<span id="aeris"></span>Cloud talks to Aeris.

**Cloud**  
Aeris...

**Aeris**  
What a shock... I didn't know Zack was from this town.

**Cloud**  
You know him?

**Aeris**  
Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.

**Cloud**  
............

**Aeris**  
Zack... SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud.

**Cloud**  
Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've never heard of him.

**Aeris**  
That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.

**Cloud**  
Missing?

**Aeris**  
I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back.  
He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else...  
Hey? What's wrong?

**Cloud**  
\- Poor guy  
\- (...jealous... envious...)

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Poor guy</span>

**Aeris**  
I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel for his parents.

**Aeris**  
Are you... jealous? Hmm? Hmmm? Are you, Cloud?

He turns away.

**Aeris**  
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

**Aeris**  
Let's go, Cloud.

<span id="tifa"></span>Cloud talks to Tifa.

**Tifa**  
Zack......

**Cloud**  
Do you know him?

**Tifa**  
N, no, I don't know him\!

**Cloud**  
Your face tells me differently.

**Tifa**  
I told you, I don't\!

**Cloud**  
A, all right.

**Tifa**  
............  
That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining SOLDIER\!'.

**Cloud**  
There were a lot of guys like that back then.

**Tifa**  
You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group like that.  
I really respect you...

**Cloud**  
\- I just got lucky  
\- I worked hard for it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I just got lucky</span>

**Tifa**  
Don't be so humble\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I worked hard for it</span>

**Tifa**  
Hard work pays off, huh.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, thanks for caring.

Back at Zack's house.

**Zack's Father**  
Have you ever met someone in SOLDIER named Zack?

**Zack's Mother**  
I can't believe he hasn't contacted us in 10 years...\! ...After all, we're his parents.

The party may choose to stop at Cosmo Canyon, but if they attempt to bypass it instead, the buggy sparks.

**Cloud**  
\!?

It continues to spark and then breaks down. Cloud gets out.

**Cloud**  
Oh man... a breakdown? Now?

<span id="arrival"></span>They head to the nearby village of Cosmo Canyon in search of a mechanic. Red XIII runs ahead when they reach the gate.

**Red XIII**  
I am home\! It is I, Nanaki\!

**Gatekeeper**  
Hey, Nanaki\! You're safe\!  
Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen\!

Red XIII runs on up a staircase along the side of the canyon.

**Cloud**  
...Nanaki?

Cloud and the others approach the gate.

**Gatekeeper**  
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Gatekeeper**  
You lied. That is something that is not treated lightly here in Cosmo Canyon.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Gatekeeper**  
Let me explain.  
People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of Planet Life.

</div>

**Barret**  
Wooooooooo\!  
I always wanted to come here\!

**Gatekeeper**  
Ummgah\! It's full capacity at present, so I'm afraid I can't let you enter.

Red XIII comes back down the stairs.

**Red XIII**  
They helped me some when I was on the road. Please let them in.

**Gatekeeper**  
...Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in.

**Cloud**  
Who is Nanaki?

**Gatekeeper**  
Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name.

\* **Note**: From this point on, that's how I'll refer to him. It's his name, after all.

Cloud and the others enter the village and go up to where Nanaki is waiting on the stairway landing.

**Nanaki**  
Here is where I was... I mean, ...this is my hometown.  
My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet.  
My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her...... I am the last of my race.

**Cloud**  
Cowardly father?

**Nanaki**  
Yes. My father was a wastrel.  
And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect this place. My journey ends here.

**Bugenhagen** (from above)  
Hey\! Nanaki--\! You're home\!

**Nanaki**  
Coming, Grandpa\!

He dashes off up the stairs.

Tasty Cocktails\! Pub "Starlet"

Come in today\!  
It's right near Cosmo Candle\!

Cloud finds Tifa and Aeris at the pub.

**Barkeeper**  
Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?'  
A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit. ...If you know when to stop.

**Aeris**  
Maybe there are some people here that know about the Promised Land and the Ancients.

**Tifa**  
Nanaki...... I wonder what's happened to Nanaki...? He's as excited as a little boy.

**Elder Bugah**  
Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?  
Yeah, thanks.

Upstairs is the inn.

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'.  
It'll be 100 gil a night. Would you like to stay?

This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle'. It has burned for generations.  
It is a holy flame that protects this canyon.  
I heard once, it only went out once, long ago.  
The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really don't know much about it.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Hello. Looking for anything in particular?

**Gatekeeper**  
Since you're here, why don't you listen to Bugenhagen's story?

At the Tiger Lily Weapons shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Oh, welcome.  
The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything here are replicas.  
But that's all right. Some of them you can really use.

In the Elder's Room...

**Elder Hargo**  
Where did I put it...? I know it's around here...

**Barret**  
There was this guy who studied 'Planetary Life' here.  
He couldn't take things the way they were, so he went to Midgar to form AVALANCHE.  
Wanna hear more?

**Cloud**  
\- Go on  
\- Not really

**Barret** (on choosing "Go on")  
Guess you could say this is where AVALANCHE was born.  
I always wanted to come here... And... I finally...... made it.  
A lot... happened...

**Cloud**  
\- And then?  
\- Yeah, whatever...

**Barret** (on choosing "And then?")  
And then...? I don't know what's going to happen, now that there is no AVALANCHE...

In the Materia shop...

**Yuffie**  
Oh man\! This place looks like a real drag. And their Materia sucks, too.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
...num... yawn... Sir,... You... forgot...... your...... change.  
...num... Yes, I'm coming...  
Are you here to shop?

**Cloud**  
\- That's right  
\- No, what's your problem?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That's right</span>

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Oh... is that so... You're here to shop?

He jumps up.

I'm sorry\! We hardly ever get any customers so...... Oh, but I DO have confidence in our materia\!  
I'm... I'm so sorry\! It seems as though I've become so used to being lazy...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No, what's your problem?</span>

**Shopkeeper**  
Oh... is that so... then leave me alone and let me... yawn... sleep...

</div>

Inside a woman's living quarters...

**Woman**  
Oh man, I'm so busy. I need more help. Mummer... complaint...

If Cait Sith is in the party...

**Woman**  
Those two... uh, Anyway, are you two friends? It really seems strange.

**Cait Sith**  
Hmm, this place seems like it has a lot of secrets.  
So, when's dinner?

**Woman**  
All right, all right. I'm making it right now.  
...But I wonder which one is going to eat...

**Kid outside Sealed Door**  
Bugenhagen sealed this door shut.  
How'd he do that? With super glue?

<span id="bugenhagen"></span>Cloud continues on up to the observatory, where Nanaki and Bugenhagen are.

**Nanaki**  
Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen.  
He is incredible. He knows everything.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit.  
Nanaki is still a child you see.

**Nanaki**  
Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity.  
So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.

**Cloud**  
15 or 16\!?

**Bugenhagen**  
He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?

**Nanaki**  
......grandfather. I want to be an adult.  
I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet.  
To do that now would destroy you in the long run.  
Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you?  
Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective.  
When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing.

**Cloud**  
......When the planet dies?

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But it's not long off.

**Cloud**  
How do you know this?

**Bugenhagen**  
I hear the cries of the Planet.

A throbbing noise starts up.

**Cloud**  
What's that?

**Bugenhagen**  
The sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, planets are born, and die.

A keening noise joins the throbbing.

**Cloud**  
What was that?

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet.  
Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer......

**Nanaki**  
They have come here on a journey to save the planet.  
Why don't you show them your apparatus?

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo\!  
But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him.

**Kid** (walking in)  
Bugenhagen\!  
Several odd looking people have come.

**Bugenhagen**  
The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden.

**Nanaki**  
He brought friends too. I'll go get them.

Nanaki starts for the door.

Cloud, please call one of them.  
Only three people can fit in grandfather's machine.

**Bugenhagen**  
Don't worry. My machine won't run away. You go and invite your friends.

Cloud runs off to invite someone.

**Barret**  
What?

**Aeris**  
Hmm?

**Tifa**  
Are you going somewhere?

**Nanaki** (in his room)  
Don't worry about me. I've seen it many times.  
It's my first time back in a while. Let me rest for a bit...

**Yuffie**  
God. I HATE studying\!

**Cait Sith**  
What did they say?

**Gatekeeper**  
Did you get to see Bugenhagen's contraption? If you haven't yet, you must\!

Back to the observatory...

**Bugenhagen**  
Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come on in.

Cloud enters the room housing the machine. If he tries to activate the machine himself...

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. That's a machine only I can use.

Cloud approaches Bugenhagen.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then let's begin.  
I'll be stand there.

Cloud gets on the machine, and Bugenhagen switches it on. The platform lifts, taking them up to an interactive model of the solar system.

> **Barret**  
> This is really somethin'\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> So pretty... It's just like the real thing\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Wow\! It's just like the real thing\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Woa\! Wooooah\! Pretty good, surprisin' me\!

**Bugenhagen**  
Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory.  
All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic System.

> **Barret**  
> Whoa\! Shootin' stars\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> Hey\! A shooting star\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Look, look\! A shooting star\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Wh, what the? A shooting star?

Cloud and the others watch the model for a while.

> **Barret**  
> This's really somethin'\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> Wow, how wonderful.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Oh\! This is amazing\!\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Whew\!\!

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it?  
Well, let's get to the subject.  
Eventually... all humans die. What happens to them after they die?  
The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls?  
The soul too returns to the Planet.  
And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same.  
The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet.  
They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'.  
Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet.  
'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget.  
A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world.  
Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet...  
Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world.  
I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this.

On the Planet model, a man is born, and dies. His spirit energy enters the Lifestream and forms a tree elsewhere. The tree dies and returns to the Lifestream. A new man is born, and dies, etc. Eventually the Lifestream covers the entire Planet.

**Bugenhagen**  
Spirit energy makes all things possible, trees, birds, and humans.  
Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for Planets to be Planets.  
What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear?

Bugenhagen takes all the Spirit energy away and the Planet model crumbles and dies.

**Bugenhagen**  
......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life.

**Cloud**  
If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed...

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within nature.  
When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it can't accomplish its true purpose.

**Cloud**  
You're talking about Mako energy, right?

**Bugenhagen**  
Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it.  
Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away.  
In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet...

He turns off the machine.

The story of the planets... and those who lived with them...  
You want to know more? Then you must listen to the words of the elders.  
Nanaki? His father a coward?  
So that's it... Nanaki's been thinking that all this time...

Cloud and the others leave to explore the place further.

**Elder Hargo**  
Ahh, here it is.  
My job is to gather all the legends and the knowledge of the planet and to make a book.  
Then, even when I return to the planet, the children may still be taught about many things...  
Mmm? Oh, we have guests. Good, good.  
I know, I know.  
You came to ask me something, right? Am I right?

**Cloud**  
\- It's about the Promised Land  
\- Not really

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">It's about the Promised Land</span>

**Elder Hargo**  
...The Promised Land. So you want to know...?  
There is no one place called the Promised Land. That's what I believe.  
No no, it does exist. Hmmm...... you can say that too.  
In other words, it doesn't exist for us, but it did for the Ancients.  
The Promised Land is the resting place of the Ancients.  
The life of the Ancients is one continuous journey. A journey to grow trees and plants, produce animals, and to raise Mako energy.  
Their harsh journeys continued throughout their lives...  
The place they returned to after their long journey... Their burial land is the Promised Land.  
Huh? Supreme Happiness? I believe that, for the Ancients, it was the moment that they were able to return to their Planet,  
At that moment they were released from their fate, and gained their supreme happiness...  
At least that's what I believe. I really don't know whether or not it's the truth now.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not really</span>

**Elder Hargo**  
Oh, that's not what you're here for?  
I'd appreciate it if you don't talk to me about such foolish things as legends and old wives tales.

</div>

**Elder Hargo**  
By the way, those that came with you are all at the Cosmo Candle.  
Are you leaving?

**Gatekeeper**  
Leaving already? But it appears your friends still want to learn more about the planet...

In the Pub...

**Elder Bugah**  
Mmm...  
What is it?

**Cloud**  
\- The story of the Ancients...  
\- Nothing

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">The story of the Ancients...</span>

**Elder Bugah**  
You can't talk of the Ancients, without mentioning Professor Gast.  
He used to come here sometimes.  
He was a Shinra scholar who spent his life studying the Ancients.  
He was a serious person, never would have figured he'd be with the Shinra.  
Must've been about 30 years ago, when he found the corpse of an Ancient. He was elated\!  
If I recall... he named it 'Jenova' and was doing a lot of research...  
One day, he showed up here, looking real distressed.  
He was mumbling something about Jenova not being an Ancient and that he'd done a terrible thing...  
He's been missing since then. I heard that he never went back to Shinra  
So, if you ever see Professor Gast, I want you to tell him...  
That the old man that likes to drink in Cosmo Canyon, wanted to hear about the Ancients.  
Well, there's lots to talk about,  
but most things about the Ancients are all legend and folk tales, and no one knows the truth.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nothing</span>

**Elder Bugah**  
...hmm. That's no fun... I wanna tell a story.

</div>

**Elder Bugah**  
By the way, your friends are all in front of the 'Cosmo Candle'  
Are you all leaving now?

<span id="candle"></span>Cloud joins his friends by the Candle.

**Nanaki**  
......

**Barret**  
Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born...  
I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate...  
Biggs... Wedge... Jessie...  
Now they're all gone... died for the planet.  
...Really? To save the planet?  
We all... we all hate the Shinra...  
Do I even got a to go on?  
Will they......... will they ever forgive me?  
...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing.  
If there's anything I can do, to save the planet... or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it\!  
I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care...... let 'em decide for 'emselves.

He gets to his feet.

Urrrrrgh\! I'm gonna do it\!\!  
Again... Again... AVALANCHE's born again\!

**Aeris**  
I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things.  
About the Cetra... And the Promised Land...  
I'm...... alone... I'm all alone now...

**Cloud**  
But I'm...... we're here for you, right?

**Aeris**  
I know. I know, but... I am the only...... Cetra.

**Cloud**  
Does that mean we can't help?

**Aeris**  
......

**Tifa**  
Cloud...  
Bonfires are funny, aren't they?  
They make you remember all sorts of things.  
You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago...  
......It's nothing.  
No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask...

**Cloud**  
What is it...?

**Tifa**  
It feels like... it feels like you're going far away...  
You really, really are...... you... right?

**Yuffie**  
What a boring place, just like I thought. I wanna go somewhere\! Let's go find some Materia\!

**Cait Sith**  
I wonder how many years it's been... Gosh, it brings back memories......

**Nanaki**  
...Long ago.  
...When I was still very small. We were all around this flame...  
No, never mind...

**Cloud**  
What happened?

**Nanaki**  
It's about my parents.  
When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy...  
And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is full of anger...

**Bugenhagen**  
...You really can't forgive your father...?

**Nanaki**  
Of course. He...... left mother for dead.  
When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving mother and the people of the Canyon\!

**Bugenhagen**  
...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see.

**Nanaki**  
...?

**Bugenhagen**  
The place may be dangerous.  
Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?

**Barret**  
...Where're they going?

**Aeris**  
I wonder what he wants to show Nanaki...?

**Tifa**  
Can I go too?

**Yuffie**  
Does he want to show him THAT? You know, maybe there's some Materia that's been passed on for generations in this Canyon\!?

**Cait Sith**  
Dangerous? Count me out......

**Elder Bugah**  
Mmm. I'm starting to feel good now. That bartender's cocktails always hit the spot.

**Gatekeeper**  
Hm? If you're looking for Bugenhagen, he went to the Sealed Door.  
Remember, there's a steel door on the way to Bugenhagen's room.  
What's that door there for anyhow? It's been closed forever...

<span id="gi"></span>Cloud and the others join Bugenhagen by the sealed door.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo  
Are we all set?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Just a minute

**Bugenhagen**  
Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?

He hits a switch to open the door.

All right. Come in, come in.

**Nanaki**  
Hey? Aren't you going with us, Grandpa?

**Bugenhagen**  
What are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that\!  
You want an old man like me should go first? I'll be right behind you.

If you try to go back out...

**Bugenhagen**  
What is it, you're going back? I'll be waiting here for you when you're ready.  
I can't leave this door open forever.  
Good. Then we shall proceed.

They enter the cave and climb to the bottom. After passing through the first chamber, Bugenhagen stops in the doorway.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo.  
Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe. Killed in a certain battle.

**Nanaki**  
A certain battle...?

**Bugenhagen**  
The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't return to the Lifestream...  
We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo.

They continue on through the second chamber, and Bugenhagen stops again.

**Bugenhagen**  
As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon.  
It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they attacked through here, we wouldn't have stood a chance.

**Nanaki**  
......

**Bugenhagen**  
Let's move on.

They move through the third chamber.

**Bugenhagen**  
This warrior went through the cave all alone.  
Fighting attackers one after another...

**Nanaki**  
Grandpa...... That warrior...

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there.

They enter the final chamber, where an evil-looking face is blocking the far exit.

**Bugenhagen**  
What is this......?

**Nanaki**  
Grandpa, is he...\!?

**Bugenhagen**  
After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air......  
This... can't be\!\!

Cloud and the others fight the Gi Nattak.

**Bugenhagen**  
...Thank you, Cloud. Because of you, we survived.  
Nanaki, you have grown strong, too.

**Nanaki**  
......Oh yeah?

**Bugenhagen**  
Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here...  
Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here.

They continue out of the cave.

**Nanaki**  
This is...

**Bugenhagen**  
...The warrior who fought against the Gi.  
He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon.  
But he was never able to return to town...  
Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto.

Nanaki looks up to where Seto stands on the cliff above, turned to stone.

**Nanaki**  
...That... That's...... Seto...?

**Bugenhagen**  
Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. ...To protect this Canyon.  
Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to stone......  
Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us.  
And he continues to protect us, even now.

**Nanaki**  
Even now...

**Bugenhagen**  
You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon.  
That is your father, Seto.

**Nanaki**  
That...... that is Seto? ...\!? Did mother know?

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo... She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep this cave shut.  
They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul.  
They said we should forget about this cave.

**Nanaki**  
.........

**Bugenhagen**  
Cloud... Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?

Cloud nods and leaves the cave.

**Bugenhagen**  
Nanaki. I want you to continue your journey with Cloud and the others.

**Nanaki**  
Grandpa\!?

**Bugenhagen**  
Listen, Nanaki.  
Cloud says they are trying to save the planet.  
Honestly, I don't think it can be done.  
For even if they stop every reactor on the planet, it's only going to postpone the inevitable.  
Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish.  
But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately.  
I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do,  
as a part of the planet, something to help a planet already in misery...  
No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?  
Am I just wishing against fate?  
I am too old to do anything about it...  
This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo.  
That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them\! For my sake.

**Nanaki**  
Grandpa...

**Bugenhagen**  
I wanted to show you your real father before you left...  
I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show you.

**Nanaki**  
Grandpa... don't talk like that. I don't want to think of life... without you......

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life.

**Nanaki**  
Grandpa\! You must live\!  
I'll see to it.  
I'll see to what's happening to the planet. And I'll come back to tell you.

**Bugenhagen**  
Nanaki...

**Nanaki**  
I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon\! The son of the warrior, Seto\!  
I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name\! So please, Grandpa...

He turns and looks up to see that Seto is crying.

**Bugenhagen**  
That's... Seto's...... Seto......

**Nanaki**  
Seto....... Fa... Father...

He leaps up higher and lets out a keening howl.

<span id="leaving"></span>Back outside, the others are gathered around the Cosmo Canyon.

**Barret**  
They said they finished fixin' the buggy.

**Cloud**  
Shall we get going?

**Aeris**  
So this is it, Nanaki...

**Barret**  
That's just the way it goes. ...You came in handy at times...

**Man**  
The repair on your car is completed.  
Now you should be able to go where ever you want.

**Cloud**  
\- How much do I owe...?  
\- Much obliged

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How much do I owe...?</span>

**Man**  
No charge\! You'd do the same for me, right?

**Cloud**  
\- Please, take 1000 gil  
\- I guess you're right

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Please, take 1000 gil</span>

**Man**  
Are you sure...? Well, all right. Thank you.  
Oh yeah. Did you stay at the inn already?  
There was a bottle on the sofa there a couple of days ago... was it yours?

Or, if Cloud doesn't have enough money:

...You don't even have that much. Don't tease me, okay?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I guess you're right</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Much obliged</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

**Man**  
Mmm...... I think the teachings of the 'Study of Planet Life' are true.  
But can people used to Mako energy ever go back...?

**Kid outside Sealed Door**  
Nope... It doesn't open... How'd he seal it? With a huge magnet?

Cloud starts for the gate, and Nanaki comes running after him.

**Nanaki**  
Wait for me\! I'm coming too\!

**Cloud**  
Mmm?

**Bugenhagen**  
Cloud. Please look after Nanaki.

**Cloud**  
What happened?

**Nanaki**  
I think I grew up a little. That's what happened\!

He runs off down the steps.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Come back whenever you need my knowledge.

Cloud and the others return to the buggy and continue north.

**Cloud**  
I'm not lying\!  
I remember... the intense heat of the flames...

<span id="explore"></span>At the inn...

**Innkeeper**  
Hi, welcome.

**Cloud**  
\- Give me a room  
\- What's your story?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give me a room</span>

**Innkeeper**  
It'll be 100 gil a night. Is that all right with you?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- Never mind.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Enjoy your stay.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Never mind.</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Well then, maybe next time...

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What's your story?</span>

This town was supposed to have been burnt down five years ago.  
What the hell is going on?

**Innkeeper**  
Sir, don't say such awful things.  
I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened.

**Tifa**  
You're lying...

**Innkeeper**  
EXUSE ME...... That's so rude...  
If you're going to talk like that to me, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  
Oh, I'm so sorry. I've got lots to do...

</div>

In the kitchen is a hunched figure in a black cape.

**Cloud**  
Man in a Black Cape?  
He has a tattoo number '6'. Hmm? He has something...

<div class="highlight">

Received "Luck Source\!"

</div>

**Clone \#6**  
Urrr...... rrrrr...... rrrgh... must... go... to... Re... uni... on...

In the neighboring store...

**Woman**  
Nice town, huh?  
We've been in business here for a long time...

**Cloud**  
...You're lying.

**Woman**  
Do you have anything to do with this town?

**Cloud**  
\- How about bein' born and raised here?  
\- Nope, guess not

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How about bein' born and raised here?</span>

I was here until I was 14 and I don't remember you.

**Woman**  
It's not nice to lie\!\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope, guess not</span>

...nothing.

**Woman**  
Oh yeah...?

</div>

By the furnace is another clone.

**Cloud**  
He has a tattoo of the number '12'. Mmm? He has something.

<div class="highlight">

Received "Elixir"\!

</div>

**Clone \#12**  
Can...... you...... hear? The... voice... of... Se... phi... ro... th......

At Cloud's house...

**Woman**  
What is it?

**Cloud**  
\- Nothing  
\- I want to hear your story

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nothing</span>

**Woman**  
Oh, really. Then, it'll help me too.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I want to hear your story</span>

I lived in this house until I was 14...  
No, but this town was burned down.

**Woman**  
Are you sick... saying those things?  
Get out of here\!

</div>

At Tifa's house...

**Clone \#5**  
...must...... get...... it... and bring... to... Se... phi... roth...  
Then... become... one... with... Se... phi... roth...

**Cloud**  
This guy's number '5'...

In the kitchen...

**Cloud**  
He has a tattoo of the number '11'...

**Clone \#11**

**Clone \#4**

In Tifa's room... Cloud walks to the piano.

**Cloud**  
But... I definitely remember playing the piano then. But why didn't it get burnt down?  
Play the piano......?

If Cloud plays all the notes on the piano 3 times...

**Cloud**  
I wonder what... this is...

<div class="highlight">

Tifa's secret savings, 1 gil came out of the keyboard.

</div>

On Tifa's desk is a report.

<div class="highlight">

"Periodic Report to Professor Hojo"

1 Clone Activity Report

Unfortunately, no 'CLONES' have left this town this quarter.  
As previously reported, the 'CLONES' seem to be sensing something.  
But all they say is, 'reunion' or 'Sephiroth' and show no other signs of activity.

2 Confidentiality Report

A total of eight people have visited this town this quarter.  
Fortunately, none knew about the incident five years ago.  
Therefore, no one knows the town was restored exactly as it was five years ago.  
Our staff, disguised as townspeople have improved their acting skills, and we do not report any problems at this time.  
That is all.

</div>

In the neighboring house's attic...

**Small Clone**  
...Re...... union.

**Smaller Clone**  
............ion

Cloud looks back and forth between them and sighs.

**Smaller Clone**  
..................

Outside the Shinra mansion are another two clones.

**Clone**  
Wooooo-----ooow...... He's... calling...... Sephiroth...... is...... calling......

**Clone 2**  
The... Great... Se... phi...... roth...... is... near......  
In... side...... inside... the Mansion...... Urrrrrrrgh...... the great...... Sephi...... roth

<span id="vincent"></span>Inside the mansion...

**Letter**  
I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my research. Even that one from the Turks.  
I scientifically altered him, and put him to sleep in the basement. If you want to find him, then search the area.  
But... this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary for you to participate if you don't want to.

**Cloud**  
There seems to be another letter.  
\- Read it  
\- Ignore it

**Letter**  
Move the dial on the safe carefully, but quickly. You have 20 seconds. You can not go past the numbers while turning. The 4 hints for the numbers are...

<div class="block">

- dial (1)  
  The lid of the box with the most oxygen.

- dial (2)  
  Behind the Ivory's short of tea and ray.

- dial (3)  
  The creek in the floor near the chair on the second floor... then to the left five steps, up nine steps, left two steps, and up six steps.

- The fourth row has been written in invisible ink... Dial (4) is (Right 97)

</div>

At the safe on the second floor...

**Cloud**  
I have a bad feeling about this...  
\- Still open the safe  
\- Don't open

Cloud opens the safe and fights the Lost Number.

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Key to the Basement"\!

</div>

The party heads down to the basement. Using the key, they enter the room with the coffins and approach the closed one in the center.

**\* Note:** Because it's possible to get Vincent after Cid joins the party, I've included his responses here as well. It's also possible to recruit Vincent while Tifa or Cid are the party leader, so their responses are included along with Cloud's.

**Vincent**  
...To wake me from the nightmare

He throws off the lid.

Who is it\!?

He sits up.

...Never seen you before. You must leave.

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
You were having a nightmare.

> **Barret**  
> I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
>
> **Aeris**  
> You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
>
> **Tifa**  
> How bad was your dream?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> ...You don't look good.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Man, you really WERE having a bad dream\! Even I feel bad\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Aren't you glad you woke up?
>
> **Cid**  
> The air's pretty heavy here. How can you sleep in a place like this?

**Vincent**  
Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone.

> **Cloud**  
> What are you saying?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What's he talking about...?
>
> **Cid**  
> What the hell are you saying?

**Vincent**  
I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.  
This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.

> **Cloud**  
> ...you can say that again.
>
> **Tifa**  
> ...That's for sure.
>
> **Cid**  
> ...It's startin' to look that way\!

**Vincent**  
Hmm? What do you know?

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
\- Don't say a thing  
\- Talk about Sephiroth

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't say a thing</span>

**Vincent**  
I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare...  
...What? More?

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
\- No, good night  
\- Tell him about Sephiroth

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Talk about Sephiroth</span>

Cloud talks about Sephiroth.

</div>

> **Cloud**  
> Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.  
> No, it's not a dream, it's for real.  
> Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion...

**Vincent**  
Sephiroth\!?

**Vincent + Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
You know Sephiroth?

Vincent leaps from the coffin and lands on its edge.

**Vincent**  
You start first.

Cloud gestures as he tells his story.

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
...That's how it was.

**Vincent**  
So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?  
...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.  
He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.

\* **Note**: Vincent's comment here is likely a translation error and should have been something like "So five years ago, Sephiroth learned that he had been created?"

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
Now it's your turn.

**Vincent**  
Sorry... I cannot speak.

> **Barret**  
> Hey\! You lyin' white-faced\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> That's dirty\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hmm... I'm disappointed.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> What... you're serious?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hey, that's not right---
>
> **Cid**  
> Good\! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here\!

**Vincent**  
Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin.  
More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had.

He gets back into the coffin.

Now... please leave.  
...You're still here.

**Cloud, Tifa or Cid**  
\- Good night  
\- Who are you?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Good night</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Who are you?</span>

At least tell us your name.

Or, from Cid:

At least say your name.

</div>

**Vincent**  
I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks...  
Vincent.

> **Cloud or Tifa**  
> The Turks\!?
>
> **Cid**  
> Turks\!?

**Vincent**  
Formerly of the Turks.  
I have no affiliation with Shinra now.  
...And you?

> **Cloud**  
> Cloud, formerly of SOLDIER.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Tifa, formerly of the AVALANCHE.
>
> **Cid**  
> Cid, formerly of the Space Program Department.

**Vincent**  
You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?

Or, to Tifa:

Ex-AVALANCHE...... Then you wouldn't know Lucrecia...

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
Who?

**Vincent**  
......Lucrecia.

> Cloud and Tifa shake their heads.
>
> **Cid**  
> No idea.

**Vincent**  
The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.

> **Cloud**  
> ...gave birth...?  
> Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
>
> **Tifa or Cid**  
> ...gave birth...?  
> Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?

**Vincent**  
That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.  
He was born from a beautiful lady.  
That lady was Lucrecia.  
She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful... Lucrecia.

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
...A human experiment?

**Vincent**  
There was no way to cancel the experiment.  
I couldn't stop her.  
That was my sin.  
I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.

> **Barret**  
> That why you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> So your punishment was to sleep? That's... kinda weird.
>
> **Tifa**  
> So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> So you slept as punishment? Isn't that strange? That thinking...
>
> **Yuffie**  
> OK. Boring story no. 1.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
>
> **Cid**  
> You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?

Vincent lies back down.

**Vincent**  
Let me sleep...

Cloud and the others start back down the hallway.

**Vincent**  
Wait\!  
If I go with you will I meet Hojo?

> **Cloud**  
> Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later...
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might......
>
> **Cid**  
> I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance...

**Vincent**  
Lucrecia...  
All right. I've decided to go with you.

> **Barret**  
> W, what?
>
> **Aeris**  
> Sure is a quick change of heart. Huh?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What? You're coming with us?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> What?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Huh? Oh great just what I needed...
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> What?
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy\!

**Vincent**  
Being a former Turks, I may be of help to you...

> **Cloud**  
> All right, then.
>
> **Tifa**  
> All right, I understand.
>
> **Cid**  
> Alright then.

<span id="library"></span>Moving onward to the library, they find Sephiroth standing in the hallway leading to the study.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth\!

**Sephiroth**  
Being here brings back memories.  
Are you going to participate in the Reunion?

**Cloud**  
I don't even know what a Reunion is\!

**Sephiroth**  
Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will join the Reunion becoming a calamity from the skies.

**Cloud**  
Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient\!?

**Sephiroth**  
...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate.  
I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then follow...

**Cloud**  
...Reunion? Calamity from the skies?

Sephiroth throws a materia orb at Cloud and then flies past him out of the library.

Back outside the mansion...

**Clone 2**  
Great...... Sephi...... roth......... left us......  
Over... mountains...... gone......

Cloud and the others leave Nibelheim to cross the mountains after Sephiroth.

<span id="explore"></span>After passing through the Nibel Mountains, Cloud and the others reach Rocket Town.

**Cloud**  
What's that...\!?

He looks up to see the rocket.

A rusty old rocket... Wonder what they'd make something that huge for?

In the Weapons Shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
A gun is a MAN'S weapon\! Ain't nuthin' else'll do\!  
Let me handle all your weapon and accessory needs\!

At the Shanghai Inn...

**Man Looking at Painting**  
Hmm. Is it real or fake?

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome to the Shanghai Inn\!  
It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Innkeeper**Yes sir. Thank you\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Innkeeper**Well then, come by again sometime.

</div>

If Cloud goes behind the counter to speak to the innkeeper...

**Innkeeper**  
Excuse me. Please don't come in here.  
Our books and the room keys are in here, so I'll have to ask you to please stay out.

**Cloud**  
The books...  
Maybe we could find out who's been here?  
\- Was there a man in a Black Cape?  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Was there a man in a Black Cape?</span>

**Innkeeper**A man with a Black Cape? No, no one like that has ever stayed here.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

Cloud shrugs.

**Innkeeper**Look, we're all adults here, So I'd appreciate it if you used some discretion.

</div>

**Barkeeper**  
Would you like something to drink?

**Cloud**  
\- Let me hear your story  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

Let me hear your story

**Barkeeper**  
Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's representative, so you should really talk with him.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Barkeeper**  
......that's too bad. Please come again.  
If he keeps up like that, he's gonna collapse someday. Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack.

</div>

**Man at Table**  
Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge of it.

**Cloud**  
\- Captain?  
\- Did you see a man in a Black Cape?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Captain?</span>

Who's the 'Captain'?

**Man at Table**  
The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program.  
He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident...  
Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Did you see a man in a Black Cape?</span>

**Man at Table**  
A man in a Black Cape? Nope... don't know a thing about it.

**Man at Table**  
A drink will ease your heart...

**Man in Bathroom**  
...I'm in here.  
P...... Urrrrgh... aaaaaghh...  
Urrrrgh, urrrgh

Back outside...

**Redhead**  
That rusted out rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space Program.

**Mechanic**  
Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were planning to launch the rocket.

Inside the house on the left...

**Man**  
Mmm, I'm so bored. Isn't there anything that can get me excited?

**Woman**  
Geeeeez, it's boring\! Isn't anything exciting going to happen here?

**Old Man outside Item Shop**  
This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets.  
You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never got off the ground though.  
It just looms there. That's how the town got its name... 'Shinra No. 26'.  
Want to look at the rocket with me?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, let's take a look  
\- No, not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, let's take a look</span>

**Old Man**  
I get so impressed every time I look at it.  
Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.  
But, out of appreciation, let me give you this.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Inside the Item Shop...

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Welcome\! This is the Item Shop.

**Old Woman**  
All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long.  
Well he's a man that really loves machinery...

Inside the house on the right...

**Old Man**  
My job's to make everyone laugh all over the world...  
Hmm, let's see... do I know any good jokes...?

<span id="bronco"></span>At Cid's house... Cloud and the others go out to the back yard to find a plane.

**Cloud**  
There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco...... This is cool.

Shera comes out of the house behind them.

**Shera**  
Um... may I help you?

**Cloud**  
No... We're just looking at it.

**Shera**  
...If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The Captain should be in the Rocket.  
I'm Shera. And what are your names?

**Cloud**  
I'm Cloud.

**Shera**  
Hmm... So you're not with the Shinra.  
I thought the approval for the reopening of the Space Program came.

**Cloud**  
......\!?

**Shera**  
President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so restless all morning.

She goes back inside.

**Cloud**  
Rufus\!\!?

<span id="cid"></span>Cloud goes to the rocket, and finds Cid inside.

**Cid**  
What're you guys doin' here?

**Cloud**  
We heard the Captain was here.

**Cid**  
Captain? I'm the Captain\!  
The name's Cid. Everyone calls me 'Captain', though.  
What d'ya want?

**Cloud**  
\- Tell me about this rocket  
\- Is Rufus coming?  
\- Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tell me about this rocket</span>

**Cid**  
Wow\! Not bad for a kid.  
Alright then, I'll explain it to you.  
You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right?  
Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer.  
Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine.  
There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger.  
They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype\! Finally, they completed the Shinra No. 26.  
They chose the best pilot in Shinra--no, in the world--me. I mean, come on.  
And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well...

He kicks the wall.

But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. That's why they became so anal\!  
And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans.  
After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got my damn hopes up... DAMN THEM\!  
Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration.  
Money, moola, dinero\! My dream was just a financial number for them\!  
Look at this rusted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man in space with this.  
Everyday, it tilts a little bit more.  
At this rate, I don't know which will come first, this thing falling down or me gettin' outta here.  
My last hope is to talk to the President......

If Cloud leaves the rocket and comes back to ask him a second time...

**Cid**  
Ummm... Just look around...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Is Rufus coming?</span>

**Cid**  
Yeah\! It must be news about restarting the Space Program.  
A young President, that's what we needed\! He still has dreams, too\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"?</span>

**Cid**  
You out of your \*&$^$\# mind\!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.

</div>

Back at the inn...

**Barkeeper**  
Would you like something to drink?

**Cloud**  
\- Let me hear your story

**Barkeeper**  
Cid's had some bad breaks. It's really no one's fault he couldn't go into space.  
Just bad luck, I guess...

<span id="shera"></span>Cloud and the others return to Cid's house.

**Shera**  
Excuse me... Cloud?  
Did the Captain say anything?

**Cloud**  
Nope...

**Shera**  
Oh...?

Cid enters.

**Cid**  
^%$\#\! Shera. What are you, blind\!?  
We got guests\!\! GET SOME TEA\! ^%$\#\!

**Shera**  
I... I'm sorry.

**Cloud**  
Really, don't mind us.

**Cid**  
Shut up\! Sit your ass down in that chair and drink your goddamn TEA\!  
Argggggggh\! DAMN, I'm pissed\!  
Shera\! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco\!  
An' make sure to serve them some tea\! All right\!?

He goes out back.

> **Barret**  
> ...damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?

> **Aeris**  
> Sheesh...\!\! What bad manners\!

> **Tifa**  
> Poor Shera.

> **Cait Sith**  
> Man, he sure seems wound up tight.

> **Vincent**

**Cloud**  
Sorry. It's our fault.

**Shera**  
No, no. He's always like this.

> **Barret**  
> He always like this? That's pretty bad\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Is it always like this...? Why is Cid so hard on you?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> I think it's a bit too harsh.

> **Yuffie**  
> What's his prob\!? I'm gonna go clean that guy's clock\!\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Is he like this all the time...? Bitin' your head off like that? I could never stand it...
>
> **Vincent**  
> ...It's amazing that you can live with it.

**Shera**  
No... It's because of my stupid mistake.  
I was the one who destroyed his dream...

**Cloud**  
What happened?

<div class="highlight">

In flashback, Cid is watching Shera as she inspects the rocket's oxygen tanks.

**Cid** (laughing)  
Hey\! Get your ass in gear\! You work like a snail\!  
Even the moon'd get tired waitin' around for your ass\!

**Shera**  
I'm... I'm sorry.

**Cid**  
Don't take so much time checkin' that \*%$^\# oxygen tank\!  
Shera, bein' careful's good, but it won't do any good, no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank.  
That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over.

**Shera**  
But...

**Cid**  
No buts\!\!  
You're not stupid, so be more efficient\!

**Shera**  
I'm sorry......

Cid joins his crew outside the cockpit.

**Men**  
Captain\! Our dreams are finally coming true\!  
We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26.  
Captain, preparations are complete\! All that's left is lift off\!

**Cid**  
Yeah\! Leave it all to me\! I'll be back in a few\!

**Men**  
All right, Captain\! Fly our dreams into outer space\!

**Cid**  
Thanks, guys\!

He enters the cockpit.

**Men**  
We're praying for your safety\!

**Cid**  
Instrument panel... all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch.

<div class="highlight-white">

Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. Beginning countdown.

</div>

**Cid**  
......finally.

A red light starts flashing.

**Cid**  
What the? What happened\!?

<div class="highlight-white">

Cid\! We have an emergency situation\!  
A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket\!

</div>

**Cid**  
What\!? Who is the little ^%$@\!?

<div class="highlight-white">

I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.

</div>

In the engine section, Shera is still checking the oxygen tanks.

<div class="highlight-white">

**Cid**  
Hey goddammit\!\! Who the &%$\#'s still in there?

</div>

**Shera**  
It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch.

<div class="highlight-white">

**Cid**  
Shera\!? What are you still doin' in there\!?

</div>

**Shera**  
I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test weren't satisfactory.

<div class="highlight-white">

**Cid**  
You stupid little ^$\#^%\!  
It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be SHIT left when we blast off\!  
You're gonna be burnt to a crisp\! You're gonna die\! You know that, doncha\!?

</div>

**Shera**  
I don't mind.  
If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done.

Back in the cockpit...

**Cid**  
Almost done\!? You're gonna die\!

<div class="highlight-white">

Cid, we must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't\!  
Starting engine\!

</div>

**Cid**  
Hey, wait a minute\! Shera's still in here\!

<div class="highlight-white">

What are you going to do, Cid? If we cancel now, it'll be another six months until the next launch\!

</div>

**Cid**  
GODDAMNIT, Shera... you wanna make me a murderer?

<div class="highlight-white">

**Shera**  
Captain\!

</div>

**Cid**  
Shera\!?

<div class="highlight-white">

**Shera**  
Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, it's all clear.

</div>

**Cid**  
Come on, Shera... hurry up... You're gonna die...

<div class="highlight-white">

30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown.  
Cid\! Forget about her. We won't make it in time\!

</div>

**Cid**  
What... what am I....... What am I supposed to do...?

<div class="highlight-white">

15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising.

</div>

**Cid**  
Oh man, the moon... outer space... my dreams...

<div class="highlight-white">

Ignite Engine\!

</div>

**Cid**  
SH---------------IT\!\!

The rocket starts to take off, but the engine stalls immediately and the rocket falls back onto the launch pad. It tilts, creaking, and comes to a stop.

</div>

**Shera**  
He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the mission, to save my life.  
After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was canceled.  
It's my fault his dream was destroyed...  
That's why... it's all right. I don't care what the Captain says, I'll live my life for him.

Cid returns.

**Cid**  
Shera\! You still haven't served 'em tea\!

**Shera**  
I... I'm sorry.

Cid sits down and props one foot up on the table.

**Cid**  
Hurry up and sit down\! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for you\!?  
They're late... Where is Rufus...?

<span id="shinra"></span>Palmer comes in.

**Palmer**  
Hey-HEY\! Long time no see\! So Cid, how ya been?

**Cid**  
Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on keepin' me waitin'\!?

He runs over.

So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?

**Palmer**  
Hey-hey\! I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you ask him?

**Cid**  
^$\#&\! Good for nothing, fat &$\#$^@\!

He goes outside.

**Palmer**  
Don't say 'fat'\!  
Hey-hey\! Tea\!  
Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and... oh yeah, don't forget the lard\!

**Shera**  
Is President Rufus here to announce that he's going to restart the Space Program?

**Palmer**  
Hey-hey? Have we met before?  
Hey-hey\! Is the tea ready yet?  
With plenty of sugar and honey. Oh yeah, and don't forget the lard too.

Cloud steps outside.

**Cid**  
What the......\! You got me all excited for nothing\!?  
Then, what'd you come here for?

**Rufus**  
I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco.  
We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction.  
But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane...

**Cid**  
&^\#^%\! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco.  
Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too\!?

**Rufus**  
Oh my...  
You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were able to fly in the first place.

**Cid**  
What\!?

**Shera** (from behind Cloud)  
Uh, excuse me...  
This way...

Cloud follows her back inside and she shuts the door behind them.

**Shera**  
You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?

Cloud nods.

**Shera**  
I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?

Cloud and the others go out back to find Palmer on the wing of the Tiny Bronco.

**Palmer**  
Hmm... Why do I have to do this...? I'm the head of the Space Program...

**Cloud**  
We'll be takin' that Tiny Bronco.

**Palmer**  
I've seen you somewhere before...  
I know\! The Shinra building\! When the President was killed\! Ulp\!  
Se... se... security\!\!

Cloud and the others fight Palmer.

**Palmer**  
Heh-hic-heh-hic\!  
Heh heh hic\!

He runs away, but gets hit by a Shinra truck pulling up.

Ugh\!

Meanwhile the Tiny Bronco is still revving up.

**Cloud**  
Forget it\! Get in\!\!

They climb aboard the Tiny Bronco as it takes off with an empty cockpit. As it swoops by Cid and Rufus, Shinra soldiers start firing at it, and Cid jumps on.

**Cid**  
Shit\!\! The tail's been hit\!

**Cloud**  
Emergency landing...

**Cid**  
This's gonna be a big splash. Hold on to your drawers and don't piss in 'em\!

The plane crashes into the ocean and drifts to a stop.

**Cid**  
She won't fly anymore...

**Cloud**  
Can't we use it as a boat?

**Cid**  
$\#&%\! Do whatever you want\!

**Cloud**  
Cid, what are you going to do now?

**Cid**  
Dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on the town.

**Cloud**  
How 'bout your wife? How 'bout Shera?

**Cid**  
Wife? Don't make me laugh\! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her gives me the chills.  
What're you guys gonna do?

**Cloud**  
We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get Rufus of the Shinra someday too.

**Cid**  
I don't know about any of that, but...  
What the hell\!? Sign me up\!

**Cloud**  
How 'bout it, everyone?

> I don't care.

**Cid**  
Glad to be aboard, numbskulls\!

**Cloud**  
Numskulls...?

**Cid**  
Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has GOTTA be a numskull\! I like it\!  
So, where we headed?  
Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the Ancients.

**Cloud**  
Really\!? ...Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?

**Cid**  
Dunno. That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?

**Cloud**  
Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the Ancients... that name bothers me.

**Yuffie**  
.........Hm. How 'bout goin' west?  
No, no reason. NO reason at all\!

Cloud and the others head for land, the closest just happening to be the Wutai continent to the west.

<span id="stolen"></span>Cloud and the others land the Tiny Bronco on the shores of Wutai and start making their way north. On a hilltop, Yuffie runs ahead and stands in their way.

\* **Note**: Because this is an optional sidequest, it is also possible to do it when either Tifa or Cid are the party leader, so their responses are included along with Cloud's.

Also, while it is possible to enter Wutai before obtaining Yuffie, there is no unique dialogue. The NPCs simply won't mention her, and the Turks will not be present. Likewise, if you enter for the first time on Disc 3, even with Yuffie, the materia sidequest will not trigger.

No, umm, uh......

If Yuffie was in the party, either Barret or Nanaki will come running up, depending on which wasn't with you.

<span id="arrival"></span>They go north and arrive in Wutai, where they immediately spot Yuffie.

**Yuffie**  
Hey\!\!

She runs off.

Outside Yuffie's house..

**Yuffie**  
This is MY house\! Nobody gets in\!

**Man on the Path to Godo's House**  
Lord Godo is in this house.  
He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......  
What, Yuffie... It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.  
But today he's not in the best of... Well, I should say... But really he's not so......

In the Weapons shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Sorry, listen I... No, nothing... never mind.

**Man**  
Sorry, but we're entirely sold out now.  
What's this here? Ah, no... that's uh...  
...a sample\! Yeah, that's it... a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?

**Barkeeper**  
Hey, hey, welcome\! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.  
Nowadays, thanks to tourism, Wutai's able to get by.

**Man**  
Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.  
They say the Water God was a huge snake\!  
Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.  
But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.  
Believe in the scales of the Water God and in materia that has its power in it.

Cloud walks up to the Turks - Reno, Rude, and Elena - who are drinking at a table.

**Elena**  
Yy, you\!? How did you get here...?

She jumps up.

Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.  
Get ready to die\!\!

Cloud and the others ready their weapons. Reno and Rude don't move.

**Reno**  
...Elena, you talk too much.

**Elena**  
Ww, what?

**Reno**  
What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?

**Elena**  
We're taking our vacation and resting up from our work.

**Reno**  
Now our vacation is ruined.

**Elena**  
B, but...

**Rude**  
...even the booze tastes bad now.

**Elena**  
...sorry...

She sits back down, and Cloud relaxes.

**Elena**  
Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight\!  
The next time we meet I won't be so nice.

**Reno**  
Drink, Rude\! How long have we been a team...?  
There have been hard times being a Turk, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.  
I even got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.

**Rude**  
To the Turks... To Reno... cheers\!

Outside the Item Shop, a little kid is running around.

**Little Kid**  
Alright, alright, alright\! I know\!  
On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao\!  
I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you\!  
A girl with materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.  
You know I've noticed that there's pounding noise from time to time in this store.

**Man on the Path to Godo's House**  
Lord Godo is in this house.  
He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep......  
Anyhow, for some reason Yuffie's had a fondness for materia ever since I can remember.  
She's always hung around places she thought might have it.

In the Item Shop...

**Item Shopkeeper**  
We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.

**Woman**  
I'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no materia left anywhere in Wutai.  
Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides...  
If we had a lot of materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't...

Cloud opens the nearby treasure chest.

<div class="highlight">

Received "MP Absorb" Materia\!

</div>

Yuffie jumps down from above.

<div class="highlight">

Stole "MP Absorb" Materia\!

</div>

**Woman**  
Huh? What? You DID?

Cloud continues up the path towards Godo's house.

**Man outside Godo's House**  
That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods...  
The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni, who has the best characteristics of everything.  
Since ancient times, we in Wutai, have worshipped Da-chao and the Water God.  
Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.  
But in the last battle, we didn't fare so well... I guess our beliefs were based on nothing more than legends.

Inside the pagoda...

**Gorky**  
...

If Cloud tries to run upstairs...

**Gorky**  
Freeze\!  
You aren't from Wutai, are you?

**Cloud**  
\- No  
\- Yes

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Gorky**  
Only those from Wutai are allowed in the tower\!  
I'll have to ask for you to leave\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Gorky**  
Hey\! I hate people who lie about their identities\! Leave this tower at once\!

</div>

<span id="godo"></span>Inside Godo's house, they find Godo lying on a futon.

**Godo**  
GOOGAH... what do you want?  
Don't have... GAH... anything much but, you should be able to... GOO... rest yourselves here. GOGAH... make yourselves at home.  
......Yuffie? ......nope, never heard of her. ...GOOGO...  
...you again? I told you once, and I'm telling you again, I don't know her.

He sits up.

Listen, I said I didn't know her\! There isn't anyone named Yuffie here in Wutai\!

He gets to his feet and turns to face Cloud.

...never seen you around here before...  
Lately I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here... You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?  
I don't care about who you are.  
But if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.  
I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder.

**Yuffie**  
What's with you, you coward\!

She jumps down from the ceiling to stand in his doorway.

**Godo**  
Yuffie......\!

**Yuffie**  
You scared of the Shinra?  
Then why don't you fall into line and obey them, just like all of the other towns\!

She runs into the room.

Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra\!

**Godo**  
Shut up\! What would you know about this?

**Yuffie**  
You get beaten once, and then that's it?  
What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?

**Godo**  
No kid like you's going to talk to me like that\!  
You keep acting like that\! You ought to be ashamed of yourself\!

**Yuffie**  
That's my style\! And it's my own business, not yours\! Don't you try and dictate what I should do\!

**Godo**  
Style...? Dictate...?  
Throwin' around all those fancy words... You're a miserable daughter\!

**Yuffie**  
Hmph\! You're a sad excuse for a father\!\!

She runs out and into the shrine down the hall. Godo starts to chase after her, but gives up and returns to his room.

**Godo**  
......take your things and get out of here now.  
To protect Wutai, we cannot afford to stand up to Shinra.

**Man on the Path to Godo's House**  
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.  
Like father like daughter...  
Yuffie's like that, you know. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.  
Then she hides in the shadows... Just like a little kid.

**Woman Walking near River**  
Life is just like the flowing of a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.  
Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.  
Yuffie? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.

At the old man's house...

**Boy**  
Oh no\! More weirdos  
No, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird too\!

**Old Man**  
Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see... what was your name?

**Boy**  
No, Gramps\! This isn't anyone you know\! This is just some stranger who barged into our house\!  
What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I...

Cloud pushes aside a screen to reveal Yuffie hiding behind it.

**Yuffie**  
......

She dashes out of the house.

**Old Man**  
Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?

**Boy**  
No, Gramps\! These guy's are creepy\! They're runnin' all over the place\!

**Man on the Path to Godo's House**  
She's always getting into fights. But in that, she takes after Godo to a tee.  
Like father like daughter...  
That reminds me, Lately I've been seeing a kid around here that reminds me of Yuffie.  
Always sneakin' around corners And into somethin' she shouldn't be.

If Cloud tries to leave Wutai...

> **Barret**  
> Wait, that damn Yuffie's still gotta be somewhere in this cheap town\! Or you all jes' gonna go on?
>
> **Aeris**  
> I don't think she came out from here... Is that ok?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Knowing Yuffie, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> I know she hasn't left town\! You still want to leave?
>
> **Vincent**  
> She couldn't have left town... I think she is must still be here... Or do you want to go on?
>
> **Cid**  
> You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be in this town somewhere\!

Outside the Turtle's Paradise, there is a barrel that's wiggling. Cloud and the others position themselves near the escape routes and then open it. Yuffie jumps out and tries to get away, but finds herself surrounded.

> **Cloud**  
> You can't get away, Yuffie.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Give it up, Yuffie\!
>
> **Cid**You lost, Yuffie.

**Yuffie**  
O... ok, I know... I was wrong......  
You win. I'll give you back your materia...

She leads them to her house, just as two Shinra soldiers run into Turtle's Paradise.

---

**Shinra Soldier**  
So our reports were right\! He IS here on vacation\!  
We've finally found him\! Get the Turks here for back-up\!

**Reno**  
...what a drag.

**Shinra Soldier**  
Wh, what was that...?

**Reno**  
Right now we're off duty and can't run off to save your butts.

**Shinra Soldier**  
We know you're off duty, but...

**Reno**  
If you knew that, then don't bother us\! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.

**Shinra Soldier**  
But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too\!

There is a pause. Reno says nothing.

**Shinra Soldier**  
All right, that's it\! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see\!

The two soldiers run out. One comes back momentarily.

**Shinra Soldier**  
And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this\!\!

He leaves again.

**Elena**  
Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea\!?  
I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk would act\!?

**Reno**  
Elena. Don't misunderstand.  
A pro isn't someone who sacrifices himself for his job. That's just a fool.

**Elena**  
Rude...?

**Rude**  
.........

**Elena**  
Well, I don't buy that\! Goodbye\!\!

She runs out.

**Rude**  
.........

**Reno**  
Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way now...

---

<span id="tricked"></span>At Yuffie's house...

**Yuffie**  
I know, the materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. ...Follow me.

She leads them down to the basement, a training room.

**Flyer on Wall**  
\[Turtle's Paradise\] No. 6  
Drink at the "Turtle's Paradise" And talk about Wutai\!  
You'll know "Turtle's Paradise" by the big pot outside\!\!

**Yuffie**  
...I've been hearing that ever since I was little.  
Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more important...  
You saw what it looks like now, right? ...JUST a resort town...  
After we lost the war, we got peace, but with that, we lost something else. Now look at Wutai...  
That's why... if I had lots of materia I could...

She starts crying.

> **Cloud**  
> Listen, Yuffie. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.  
> You've got our materia and I want it back... now.  
> If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
>
> **Tifa**  
> I'm sorry, Yuffie. I know how you feel, but we need materia too.  
> ...We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
>
> **Cid**  
> ......Dammit, Yuffie. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.  
> If you want materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.

**Yuffie**  
I know. I know that...  
That... sniff... switch... the lever on the left...... materia's... sniff, hic... in there.

**Barret**  
Ain't nuthin' we can do about it...

**Aeris**  
I feel bad, but......

**Tifa**  
Now, the Materia...

**Nanaki**  
Were we a little too harsh on her?

**Cait Sith**  
Well, let's get our materia back.

**Vincent**  
There was nothing else to do.

**Cid**  
Hmmph... I dunno......

**Cloud**  
\- Flip the Left Lever  
\- Flip the Right Lever

Regardless of which lever he pulls, a cage comes down atop the party members.

> **Barret**  
> Wh...what the hell is this\!?
>
> **Aeris**  
> Eyaaaaah
>
> **Tifa**  
> Eyaaaaah
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Wh, what are you doing\!?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Wh, what is this\!?
>
> **Vincent**  
> \!?
>
> **Cid**  
> Whoa\!?

**Yuffie**  
Ha ha ha------\! Never trust anyone that easily\!\! / Ha ha------\! You should've listened\!\!  
The Materia's mine\! Tough\!  
You want your materia? Then go find it yourself\!  
Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the materia, remember you gotta steel it.  
Heh heh... steel... steel\! Get it?  
C ya\!\!

She runs off. If Cloud tries to run after her without helping the others...

> **Barret**  
> Y, yo, wait up\!\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> Wait, don't leave us\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> W...wait don't leave us here\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Help us first\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hey help us...please\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> Wait, don't go by yourself\!
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey\! Help me first\!

Cloud frees the others from the cage and they go looking for her.

At the Turtle's Paradise...

**Barkeeper**  
Seems like the town got really boisterous since you arrived. Did anything happen?

If you have now obtained all 6 Turtles Paradise flyers...

**Barkeeper**  
Congrats\! You have just found all six flyers for the "Turtles Paradise"\!  
How wonderful\! Now here is your prize, just as we promised\!\!

**Barkeeper**  
Please come again to "Turtles Paradise"\! We're looking forward to seeing you\!

**Reno**  
......It's just that we're off duty\!  
I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.

**Rude**  
.........

<span id="corneo"></span>Cloud goes to the bell near Godo's house to find the gate open. When he rings the bell, a hidden door opens. Going inside, he finds Yuffie being abducted by a man in black.

**Yuffie**  
Let go\! I SAID let GO\!  
Hey\! Who do you think I...... OW\! What're you doin'...? Jerk\!

> **Cloud**  
> You......\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Oh\! You're......\!
>
> **Cid**  
> Ww, who are you\!?

**Corneo**  
......ho..... ...............ho.........  
Hohi, hohi\! Hohihi\!

> **Cloud**  
> Corneo\!?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Don Corneo\!?
>
> **Cid**  
> The hell are you doing\!

**Corneo**  
Hohi\!  
I've finally got a new chicky\!  
Two for one, in fact\! Hohi, hohi\!

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
Two\!?

**Elena**  
H......hey\! Let go of me\! You're gonna regret this\!\!

**Corneo**  
Hohi, hohi\! Hohihi\!

Corneo and his lackeys run off. If Cloud leaves and enters Godo's house from the front, he finds two Shinra soldiers blocking the way into the shrine.

**Shinra Soldier**  
Now listen up\! They must be in the area\! Find them no matter what\!

**Shinra Soldier**  
Yes, sir\!\!

On following Corneo up from the hidden room into the shrine, three Shinra soldiers cut Corneo off.

**Shinra Soldier**  
There he is\! It's Corneo\! Don't let him get away\!  
Attaaaack\!

Corneo runs to the side, and the soldiers attack Cloud and the others instead. Back outside Godo's house, they find Reno and Rude.

**Reno**  
Hmm... that Corneo is good at escaping...

**Rude**  
......Elena.

**Reno**  
Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.

Rude nods and runs off.

**Reno**  
......Sounded pretty good.

He turns to Cloud.

If Elena is in his hands, that's going to make things a little difficult.  
And uh...

> **Cloud**  
> ......Ok. Corneo took Yuffie from us.  
> And without Yuffie, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
>
> **Tifa**  
> ......all right. Corneo stole Yuffie from us, as well.  
> And without her, there's no way we'll get our materia back.
>
> **Cid**  
> ......that's just beautiful\! And now that \*\#$^@'s walked off with Yuffie, too\!  
> And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our materia\!

**Reno**  
Don't misunderstand.  
We have no intention of joining you. But for now, we'll agree not to bother each other. That's all.

> **Cloud**  
> That's fine. We have absolutely no intention of cooperating with the Turks either.  
> Now, uh, just what direction did Corneo run off to?
>
> **Tifa**  
> The same goes for us. We don't want to be friendly with the Turks.  
> Now which direction did Corneo run off in?
>
> **Cid**  
> Of course\! There ain't no way we'd wanna join up with the Turks anyway\!  
> Anyhow, which direction did that %^$\*& run off in?

**Reno**  
Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the place that stands out the most.

Reno runs off.

**Man on the Path to Godo's House**  
Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is starting to become popular with the kids?  
One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like Yuffie.

**Little Kid**  
Alright, alright, alright\! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao\!  
He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he could float\! It almost bowled me over\!

Cloud arrives at Da-chao.

**Reno**  
You're finally here. We're gonna split into two.  
You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.  
Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, Yuffie.  
For now...

Following Reno up the mountain...

**Reno**  
Don't fool around. You know the enemy's not gonna wait for us, right?

Following Rude, they find him outside the fire caves...

**Rude**  
......

If Cloud tries to proceed through the fire caves...

> **Cloud**  
> Whoa\!\!  
> Can't go through here... That flame would make crispy critters of us in an instant.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Eyaaaah\!  
> There is no way past this\!
>
> **Cid**  
> Damn, that's hot\!  
> I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot\!

In the end they find Corneo holding Yuffie and Elena tied to the face of a statue, observing them from the palm of the statue's hand.

**Yuffie**  
LET... ME...... GO\!\!\!\!

**Corneo**  
Hmm\! Delicious... scrumptious\! I think I've just found a new HOBBY\!  
Which shall it be? Hmm... Hmm...  
Should I go... with HER?

**Elena**  
He... hey, I'm one of the 'Turks'\! Don't think you can get away with this\!?

**Corneo**  
Or... maybe... HER?

**Yuffie**  
Oh GAWD\! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken rope escape lessons more seriously\!\!

**Corneo**  
Hmm\!\!\! I've made my choice\! My companion for the night will be......  
...the cheerful one\!

**Yuffie**  
GROSS-NESS\!  
Don't mess with me old man\! You don't even have any Materia\!

**Corneo**  
Oooooh\! And she's saucy, too\! Wheee\! Wheee\!

> **Cloud**  
> All right, that's it\!\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hold it right there\!
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey, hey, hey\! That's as far as you go\!

**Corneo**  
Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on\!? Who's there?

Cloud and the others run in.

**Yuffie**  
Oh man\! Cloud......\!

Or, if Tifa:

Oh man\! Tifa......\!

Or, if Cid:

Oh man\! That old fart, Cid......\!

**Corneo**  
Wheeel... long time no see.

**Cloud**  
Don't tell me you forgot...

> **Barret**  
> You damn Midgar hyena...\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> You just don't get it, do you...\!?
>
> **Tifa**  
> That fall into the trap really hurt\!

> **Cait Sith**

> I don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it...
>
> **Cid**  
> Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^\#@\# like you, but I won't\!

**Corneo**  
Be quiet\! None of you know how much I've suffered since then...  
It's a long story, but......

> **Cloud**  
> I don't really care\! Let Yuffie and Elena go\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> We don't want to hear it\! Just let the two go\!
>
> **Cid**  
> I don't really give a damn\! You're gonna let the two girls go, or else I'm gonna break your arm\!

**Corneo**  
Hmm... You guys are... serious. ......Good, good.  
...this ain't no time for me to be fooling around either...  
Why did you kill my little Aps?  
I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't get in the way of my search for a bride\!  
RAPPS---come here\!\!

Cloud and the others fight and defeat Rapps.

**Corneo**  
Wait...  
Just wait a second\!

> **Cloud**  
> SHUT UP\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> You better say your prayers\!
>
> **Cid**  
> Don't be such a poor loser, old man\!

**Corneo**  
Just listen to me - it won't take long.  
Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
\- 1 Because he's ready to die  
\- 2 Because he's sure to win  
\- 3 Because he's clueless

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">1 Because he's ready to die</span>

**Corneo**  
Hmm...\! WRONG...\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">2 Because he's sure to win</span>

**Corneo**  
Hmm...\! RIGHT\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">3 Because he's clueless</span>

**Corneo**  
Hmm...\! Close, but no cigar...\!

</div>

Corneo pushes a button and Elena and Yuffie flip upside down.

**Elena**  
Eyaaaah...\!

**Yuffie**  
Makes me so MAD...\!

**Corneo**  
If I push this button, they'll fall upside down, and we'll have a SQUASHED TOMATOES\!

**Cloud**  
Damn...\!

> **Barret**

**Corneo**  
Now, give me your women too\!  
Ha, ha, ha, ha\! I guess I'm the one laughing last\!

**Reno**  
No, that would be us.

**Corneo**  
Hee-haw. What... what's goin' on\!? Who's there?

Enter Reno.

**Corneo**  
...The Turks\!

**Reno**  
You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.  
We're going to take care of you... personally.

**Corneo**  
DAMMIT\! Then they're all goin' with me\!

Rude runs in from behind and throws something at Corneo, who falls to the edge of the hand.

**Corneo**  
Ugh...\!

**Reno**  
Good timing, Rude.

**Rude**  
...Let's get to work.

Reno walks over to Corneo and steps on his fingers.

**Reno**  
All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.  
Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you...?  
1\. Because we were ready to die  
2\. Because we were sure of victory  
3\. Because we were clueless

**Corneo**  
Two... Number two?

**Reno**  
All wrong.

He grinds his foot into Corneo's hand.

**Corneo**  
No...\! Wait, sto......\!

He loses his grip and falls.

Aaaaaaaaaa......p

**Reno**  
The correct answer was...

**Rude**  
...because it's our job.

**Elena**  
Oh, thank you very much...\!  
I never expected you'd to come help......

**Reno**  
Elena, don't act so weak.  
You're a Turks\!

**Elena**  
Y... Yes, sir\!

> **Barret**  
> Never thought you'd come an' help us...
>
> **Aeris**  
> Thanks for your help.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Th... Thanks.

> **Nanaki**  
> I'll just say you... helped.

> **Cait Sith**  
> You guys have some good in you.
>
> **Vincent**  
> It would appear thanks are in order...
>
> **Cid**  
> I guess, thanks for today.

**Rude**  
......

Reno's cell phone rings, and he answers it.

**Reno**  
Yes... this is Reno.  
Yes... Yes... I'll get on it right away.

**Elena**  
Was that the company?

**Reno**  
Yeah, they want us to find Cloud...

Cloud and the others ready their weapons.

**Rude**  
Are we on...?

**Reno**  
No, today we're off duty.

**Yuffie**  
Hey---who cares about that\!? Get----me-----down----\!

<span id="return"></span>Back at Yuffie's house. She darts around putting the materia back in its slots.

**Yuffie**  
Phew, perfect. Now the materia is back in its rightful place.

> **Cloud**  
> Hey... the placement of it is all messed up.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hey, what is this...? The placement of it's all messed up\!
>
> **Cid**  
> What the hell's goin' on\!? The placement of the materia's all messed up\!

**Yuffie**  
Huh? Oh, it'll be all right...  
Don't be so picky\!  
Anyways, that sure was close......  
No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang\!\!

She shakes her fist and turns away.

That Corneo guy's a real pain.

Behind her back, Cloud and the others exchange looks.

**Yuffie**  
I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy.

Cloud and the others walk out.

**Yuffie**  
Oh, by the way, some of those guys from the Turks are good, huh?  
At least, after all that, we got the materia back.  
Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey...

She turns around to notice they've gone.

......Hey\!\! W...... Wait\!  
Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.

She runs into her room to grab something and comes back out.

Here, look, look\!

<div class="highlight">

Received "MP Absorb" Materia\!

</div>

**Yuffie**  
.........  
Come on, wait---\!

She runs out after them.

No matter what anyone says, I'm going with you\!  
...next time......

---

<span id="pagoda"></span>After everything has died down, they can go back to Wutai so Yuffie can climb the pagoda.

**Woman Walking near River**  
Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.

In the Weapons Shop...

**Man**  
Listen, I'm sorry about last time. Yuffie told me not to sell anything to you.

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Hey yo\! Welcome\!  
Strike while the iron's hot, I say\! We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace\!

**Little Kid**  
Alright, alright, alright\! I know\!  
On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao\!  
I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you\!  
Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright\! I don't know\!

Cloud and the others enter the pagoda.

If Yuffie is in the party and they try to proceed to the second floor without fighting...

**Gorky**  
Freeze\!  
Miss Yuffie\! You cannot go on to the second floor until you defeat me\!

**Gorky**  
Oh, Miss Yuffie\! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?

**Yuffie**  
\- Yeah, that's it  
\- No way\!

**Gorky**  
Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor\!

A boy runs down from upstairs.

**Shake**  
Yo\! They call me Shake\! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky\!

**Gorky**  
Then, begin\!  
Power Change\!

Yuffie fights Gorky.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she loses...</span>

**Gorky**  
It's just my opinion, but you need more training\! Gorky is disappointed\!

**Shake**  
No good\! You have to do Gorky\! Are you mocking this Pagoda?

**Yuffie**  
Shut up\! Shut up\! SHADDUP\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she wins...</span>

**Gorky**  
Here I am, Miss Yuffie\!

**Yuffie**  
Of course\!

**Shake**  
Hmm, I thought you were just a wild girl, but you handled that pretty well\!  
Well, we'll see how you do on next one...

</div>

Shake goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Gorky without Yuffie in the party...

**Gorky**  
Winning Miss Yuffie's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.

On the second floor, without Yuffie...

**Shake**  
You aren't good enough to be here\! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts\!

Once Yuffie proceeds to the second floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...

**Shake**  
Hey, you there\! Don't ignore me\!

**Yuffie**  
Who's next?

**Shake**  
Are you blind? I'm right here\!

**Yuffie**  
What? I gotta fight a punk?

**Shake**  
Heh\! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl\!

**Yuffie**  
Wh, what did you say\!?

**Shake**  
See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature\!  
Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me\!

**Yuffie**  
Now watch...\!

**Shake**  
'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe\! Sure you're brave enough to fight\!

**Yuffie**  
\- Stop yappin'\!  
\- I'll forgive you

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Stop yappin'\!</span>

**Chekhov**  
Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'll forgive you</span>

**Shake**  
So when it comes down to it, you're just all talk. Brat\!

</div>

Once Yuffie decides to fight, a woman comes down from upstairs.

**Chekhov**  
So, I guess it's time for Chekhov to stand in...

**Shake**  
Here I go, brat\! Speed Change\!

Yuffie fights Shake.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she loses...</span>

**Shake**  
HYAAAAAAH\! BRATBRATBRATBRAT\!\!

**Chekhov**  
You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.

**Yuffie**  
Shut up\! Shut up\! SHADDUP\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she wins...</span>

**Shake**  
URRGRAAAAGH\! So you CAN fight a bit\!

**Yuffie**  
Of course\!

**Chekhov**  
Ho, ho, ho... It's been a while since I felt pain...

</div>

Chekhov goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Shake without Yuffie in the party...

**Shake**  
Compared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies.

On the third floor, without Yuffie...

**Chekhov**  
That being the case, we have nothing further to discuss.

Once Yuffie proceeds to the third floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...

**Chekhov**  
How dare they mock us like that, thinking they could sneak past us.

A man comes down from the fourth floor.

**Staniv**  
So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, Chekhov.

**Chekhov**  
Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes. Staniv, you watch over there.

**Yuffie**  
That ain't going to happen\! I'll teach you about the strength of youth\!

**Chekhov**  
Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.

**Yuffie**  
\- I got insurance  
\- Let's get this over with, old bag

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I got insurance</span>

**Chekhov**  
Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic...  
Magic Change\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let's get this over with, old bag</span>

**Chekhov**  
Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers\!?

**Staniv**  
First, Chekhov will keep you company...

</div>

Yuffie fights Chekhov.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she loses...</span>

**Chekhov**  
Ho, ho, ho\! What does a immature young child know...?

**Staniv**  
So this IS the average person's limit...

**Yuffie**  
Shut up\! Shut up\! SHADDUP\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she wins...</span>

**Chekhov**  
I can't believe you beat me...

**Yuffie**  
Of course\!

**Staniv**  
This should be interesting...\! It's been a long time since I've had a chance to use my powers to their fullest...

</div>

Staniv goes upstairs. If Cloud returns to talk to Chekhov without Yuffie in the party...

**Chekhov**  
Managing that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.

On the fourth floor, without Yuffie...

**Staniv**  
If it were not for Miss Yuffie, I wouldn't be facing him...

Once Yuffie proceeds to the fourth floor, she can try to go to the next floor prematurely...

**Staniv**  
HAAAAH\!

The door closes.

**Staniv**  
The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent... Although it's a five-storied pagoda, the fourth floor is the highest...  
In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry\!  
You still want to try...?

**Yuffie**  
\- Just come on\!\!  
\- I'll pass\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Just come on\!\!</span>

**Staniv**  
I like you\! Now watch...  
Weapon Change\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'll pass\!</span>

**Staniv**  
You don't seem like the kind of person who can make it to the fourth floor without a problem...

</div>

Yuffie fights Staniv.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she loses...</span>

**Staniv**  
How unfortunate\! It was over before I could even put all of my strength into it...

**Yuffie**  
Shut up\! Shut up\! SHADDUP\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If she wins...</span>

**Staniv**  
Wh, what...\!?

**Yuffie**  
Of course\!

</div>

The others start coming up from the lower floors.

**Gorky**  
Splendid\! Your level and skills have improved...

**Shake**  
Oh, ho\! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were\!

**Chekhov**  
Of course. If WE lost to her...

**Staniv**  
You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM......\!

He goes upstairs, and the others follow. If Cloud proceeds to the fifth floor without Yuffie...

**Godo**  
...Hm. You can do it......

Once Yuffie proceeds to the fifth floor, she finds the four of them standing on either side of the room with Godo at the head.

**Gorky**  
......

**Shake**  
Sh......\!

**Chekhov**  
...

**Staniv**  
......

**Yuffie**  
D, ...Dad\!?

**Godo**  
I'm glad you made it this far, Yuffie\!

**Yuffie**  
Why, why are you......

**Godo**  
I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me\!  
Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me\! If you don't... then I'll have to kill you\!

**Yuffie**  
H... hey\!

**Godo**  
What are you doing\! OMNI-Change\! ......\!\!

Yuffie fights Godo.

If she loses...

**Yuffie**  
Dammit......

**Godo**  
Ohhh\! And what was that\!? Come back when you get more training\!

When Yuffie tries again...

**Yuffie**  
I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister\!

**Godo**  
Hmm? A slight improvement.  
Come at me with all you have\! OMNI-Change\! ......\!\!

After winning the battle, both lie sprawled on the floor panting.

**Yuffie**  
...heave...... heave...

**Godo**  
...huff...... puff......

**Yuffie**  
O... old coot... n...... ot... bad...

**Godo**  
You've...... also...... improved...

**Yuffie**  
Hah... Ha, ha......

**Godo**  
...Heh, heh......

**Yuffie**  
Ha ha haaaaaa......\!

**Godo**  
Waha haaaaa......\!

They eventually get up off the floor and compose themselves.

**Godo**  
It's time I gave this to you, Yuffie...  
This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.

<div class="highlight">

Received "Leviathan" Materia\!

</div>

**Staniv**  
But, Lord Godo. The Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom...

**Yuffie**  
CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM... I'm so sick of hearing that\!  
It's so stupid\!

**Gorky**  
Silence, Miss Yuffie\!

**Yuffie**  
Then what 'bout the rest of you? You have all that power...  
Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?

**Godo**  
Yuffie...\!

**Yuffie**  
You too, dad...\! Just because you lost the war\!  
And turning Wutai into a place like this\!

**Chekhov**  
...What do you want to say?

**Yuffie**  
You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists...  
How dare you\!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed\!\!

**Godo**  
...

**Shake**  
She IS a kid.

**Yuffie**  
Wh, what did you say...\!?

**Godo**  
Yuffie\!\!  
Forgive me... It's all my fault...

**Gorky**  
What are you saying, Lord Godo\!

**Godo**  
Losing the war... turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault...

**Chekhov**  
Lord Godo\!

**Godo**  
Silence\!\!  
Yuffie......  
I am the same now as I was before when I wanted the war.  
But, after I lost the war, I began to think...  
Is strength, only for defeating the enemy?  
...or just something to show-off to others...?  
Might begets might.  
That's the same way as the Shinra...

**Yuffie**  
......

**Godo**  
I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.  
But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai...  
And now, I realize both are necessary...  
Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless...\!

**Staniv**  
Lord Godo...

**Godo**  
You there, please take Yuffie with you\!  
I perceive that you all have both determination and strength\!

> **Barret**  
> Jes' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia...\!
>
> **Aeris**  
> All right. We'll take your daughter with us.
>
> **Tifa**  
> ...after that, how can we refuse?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> As long as she doesn't get in our way...\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> If you put it that way, we can't refuse...
>
> **Vincent**  
> Hmm... You may come if you want to...
>
> **Cid**  
> Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' Cid\!

**Cloud**  
All right, I don't mind.

**Godo**  
Go, Yuffie\!  
For the sake of strengthening Wutai\!

**Yuffie**  
Dad...

**Godo**  
I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return\!  
Go\! And come back alive\!

**Yuffie**  
......  
Of course\!

Everyone else files out, and Yuffie starts to follow them.

**Godo**  
Yuffie, wait a minute.  
The Materia they all have...  
After their battle is over, you think they'll still want it?

**Yuffie**  
Dad...\!

**Godo**  
Go\! Survive till the end\! And return\!  
With the Materia\!

**Yuffie**  
Heh, heh... you bet\!

She runs off.

Afterwards...

**Godo**  
Go\! Survive to the end\! And return to us\!  
Mat-...  
Take care of the Materia\!\!

Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:

Your Mat-...  
I mean, please look after Yuffie...\!

**Staniv**  
Miss Yuffie. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that...

Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:

Please take care of Miss Yuffie.

**Chekhov**  
Fight so that you never bring shame on Wutai.

Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:

She's always like this. It'll be rougher on you.

**Shake**  
You say there's some unusual materia where the underground pipe is\!?  
But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head. You won't be able to do it.

Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:

Did that kid mature at all?

**Gorky**  
Miss Yuffie. We pray for your success\!

Or, if Yuffie is not in the party:

Oh, you there\! How is Miss Yuffie doing?

Cloud and the others leave Wutai and return to their quest.

**Choco Bill**  
Welcome.  
How 'bout a Chocobo Lure materia?  
Each level it increases, makes it easier for you to find a Chocobo.

<span id="sleep"></span>In the Sleeping man's cave, across the river north of Junon...

**Old Man**  
You've already fought x times... ......zzzzz....... zzzzzzzz......  
Come on. You already escaped x times. ......zzz...... zzzzzzzzz......  
Large materia needs high level materia............ zzzzzz...... zzzzzzzz......

<span id="junon"></span>At Junon...

In Lower Junon...

**Fisherman**  
There's a dolphin in the bay. If you get close enough and blow the whistle, it might come to you.  
If you want to get on the ship, why not have the dolphin take you?

In Priscilla's House, Priscilla is asleep in her bed.

**Priscilla**  
No... that tickles...  
No... Stop......  
Mr. Dolphin......

**Elevator Guard**  
If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil\!

**Cloud**  
\- Okay, I guess  
\- No way\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Okay, I guess</span>

The elevator door opens.

**Elevator Guard**  
Hurry up and get in\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No way\!</span>

**Elevator Guard**  
You're such a cheapskate.

On the Junon Airport Path...

**Soldier**  
All I wanted was to become a pilot\! It used to leave me speechless watching the Highwind in the sunset\!

**Soldiers Practicing Victory Poses**  
Someday I'll get to use my special pose in a real battle\!  
Same here\!\! I'll keep practicing until then\!

In the weapons shop...

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Hey\! Yo\! You want weapons?

In the bar, Rude is gone but the rest of the bald club remains...

**Bald Black Man**  
It just isn't a party without Rude\!

In the barracks, a commander stands reprimanding a soldier.

**Commander**  
Hey\!\! Stay out of the way\!

**Soldier**  
Ever since I was late to that parade, they've been on my back everyday with basic training.  
I can't handle it anymore\!

**Commander**  
Hey\! Stop yappin'\!

**Soldier Studying**  
Ugh... My eyes are tired... No, this is the time for me to really buckle down\!  
Until I become SOLDIER First Class.

**Soldiers Sleeping**  
ZZZZZ......  
Grrrrgh--- ---Grrrgh

Cloud can take the lifts up to the base, but soldiers guard the way inside.

**Soldiers**  
You can't pass.

On the path to the Underwater Reactor, a group of soldiers is drilling.

**Commander**  
Hey\!\! Civilian\!\! Stay out of our training\!\!  
Go around them\! And stay out of their way\!\!

Cloud can get on the elevator to the Underwater Reactor.

**Elevator Attendant**  
...gulp... Going do---wn.  
This floor is the Submarine Dock...  
Those of you visiting the Underwater Reactor, please proceed through the connecting tunnel.  
...gulp... We're here...

Cloud gets off the elevator. The two doors leading farther are guarded by soldiers.

**Soldier**  
Only authorized personnel are allowed past this point\!  
You know too, right? About Junon Navy's important classified information.  
A new submarine has almost been completed using Shinra's top technology.  
A new version of submarine. I'll be sailing on it. Man, I can't wait\!

**Soldier 2**  
Man...... It's so boring keeping watch at the Underwater Reactor.

Taking the elevator back up...

**Elevator Attendant**  
...gulp... Going u---p.  
Returning to Junon.  
...gulp... We're here...

At the Shinra Member's bar...

**Bartender**  
I'm sorry. The bar is only for Shinra employees.

**Soldier**  
I'm a good lookin' man once I take my uniform off.

**Soldier 2**  
Mommy... My mommy...

**Soldier 3**  
Booze, booze\! Ain't nothing like booze during working hours.

Inside Junon Inn...

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome to the 'Inn'd of the line' in Junon. Wait, I shouldn't be sayin' stuff like that.  
Wanna spend the night?  
\- 30 gil  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">30 gil</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Enjoy your stay.

Cloud and the others rest.

**Innkeeper**  
Good morning\! You still seem a little sleepy.  
Looking forward to seeing you again.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Come again.

</div>

In another barracks...

**Soldier**  
These barracks are for soldiers. This is no place for civilians.

In the streets just outside the docks...

**Sailor**  
How 'bout a ship taxi? Only in Junon\!  
Free to Air Force personnel\!

**Cloud**  
\- Sure, call 'em  
\- Nope

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Sure, call 'em</span>

**Sailor**  
Roger\!\! Hey\! Taxi\!\!

A helicopter comes.

**Pilot**  
Where to?

**Cloud**  
\- The next town  
\- Outside Junon

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">The next town</span>

**Pilot**  
Right\! The next town it is\!\!

He flies Cloud to the streets outside the airfield.

Thanks\!\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Outside Junon</span>

**Pilot**  
Then outside Junon it is\! Take care\!\!\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Nope</span>

**Sailor**  
Just holler whenever you want a ride\!  
If you get sick easily, maybe you'd better not go.

</div>

**Soldier outside Cargo Ship**  
Lately it seems like the economy's been better. Must be the 'Rufus' effect.  
Cargo ships are always coming and going from Costa del Sol.  
Now I'll overlook the fact that you're a stowaway, but you better at least help with the cargo.

---

<span id="costa"></span>At Costa del Sol...

**Man Near Sea Plane**  
Hey, who're you? You look like you've been around the world twice.  
I don't know what your story is, but hang in there.

**Woman Lounging on Sea Plane**  
Today's a great day for a nap in the sun. It always puts me in a good mood\!

**Sailor**  
Thinking of being stowaways?  
It's 100 gil to Junon. Give it to me, and I'll put in a good word with the captain.  
What'll we do?

**Cloud**  
\- Pay up  
\- Don't do it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Pay up</span>

**Sailor**  
Okay. Come on. This way.  
It's not the most pleasant ride but make the best of it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't do it</span>

**Sailor**  
Thank you. Come back any time you want to stowaway on our ship.

</div>

**Sailor Running Around**  
Ever since Rufus complimented him, he ran around for a while, And we haven't heard a peep from him since...

Along the streets...

**Women Walking Around**  
Why's that\!?  
Not yet\!\!  
Eaghhh\!  
It's your fault\!  
What's wrong with you\!?  
You wanna go\!?  
Whew\!\!\!

**Little Girl**  
It hurts when you kick me with your bare feet\!

At Johnny's house, after getting the buggy...

**Johnny**  
Heh, heh, heh\!...... My woman and me are getting along pretty good.  
But I'm such a pitiful waste......

Later...

**Johnny**  
...sigh...... I'm not good enough for her. What I should do?

At the beach...

**Man**  
Always the same story... Women never pay any attention to me...

**Woman**  
If this is your idea of flirting... forget it. I do fine as it is.

**Woman 2**  
The sea, the wind and the sun. Don't you just love the outdoors? It always puts me back on track.

**Woman 3**  
Hey, good timing. Would you mind putting lotion on me?

**Cloud**  
\- With pleasure  
\- Sorry

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">With pleasure</span>

Cloud laughs and puts lotion on her.

**Woman 3**  
Uhhhnn...  
Than--kyu\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Sorry</span>

**Woman 3**  
Hey, loosen up a bit.

<span id="weapon"></span>Cloud enters the Weapon seller's house.

If he comes before obtaining the Tiny Bronco, the house is empty...

**Cloud**  
...No one's here. We'll come back later.

After obtaining the Tiny Bronco...

**Weapon Seller**  
Huh? Oh another customer. You sure picked an out of the way place but...  
But if it's the "Keystone" you're looking for, you're too late. Don't have it.

**Cloud**  
Keystone?

**Weapon Seller**  
What? You didn't come here for that?  
The "Keystone" is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere.  
You're not going to believe your ears,  
But I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients\!\!

**Cloud**  
The Temple of the Ancients...

**Weapon Seller**  
Kya, hah hah hah...  
Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend\!  
Huh? What?

**Cloud**  
\- Where is this "Keystone"?  
\- Where is the Temple?  
\- Let's change the subject  
\- Never mind

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where is this "Keystone"?</span>

**Weapon Seller**  
I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really want to sell it but...  
That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not be a good idea NOT to sell it to him...

**Cloud**  
Who did you sell it to?

**Weapon Seller**  
The manager of the Gold Saucer... think his name was "Dio". Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where is the Temple?</span>

**Weapon Seller**  
Come on... it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure would be something, huh?  
Now that you mention it, I have heard of something called Ultimate Destruction Magic  
was supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the Ancients.

**Cloud**  
Ultimate Destruction Magic...?

**Weapon Seller**  
Come on\! I told you not to take it seriously\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let's change the subject</span>

**Weapon Seller**  
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials...  
Hey you wouldn't happen to have any Mythril on you, would you? I'll trade you something good if you could spare some.

**Cloud**  
\- Give him some  
\- Forget it

**Weapon Seller**  
Hey thanks\! All right you can help yourself to either a big or small box.

When checking the wooden chest downstairs:

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Gold Armlet"\!

</div>

When checking the wall safe upstairs:

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Great Gospel"\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Never mind</span>

Nothing happens.

</div>

If Cloud tries to open something without giving him Mythril...

**Weapon Seller**  
Hey, don't just come bargin' in here\!

If Cloud walks to the bed...

**Weapon Seller**  
What? You want to rest?

**Cloud**  
\- Yep  
\- Nope

**Weapon Seller**  
Oh all right. You can use that bed.

<span id="cosmo"></span>At Cosmo Canyon...

**Gatekeeper**  
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home.

Or, if Nanaki is in the party:

Oh, Nanaki's with you. Make yourselves at home.

**Kid near the Cosmo Candle**  
Nanaki, are you leaving again? We want you to stay here forever...

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn' As long as there are guests, our lights will always be on.  
It is 100 Gil a night. Would you like to stay?

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. You people.  
Where is Nanaki? I hope he's not bothering you.

Or, if Nanaki is in the party:

Ho Ho Hoooo. I'm glad you're back, Nanaki.  
I hate to ask you but, please look after Nanaki from now on.

<span id="rocket"></span>On returning to Rocket Town...

At the Shanghai Inn...

**Barkeeper**  
Would you like something to drink?

**Cloud**  
\- Let me hear your story

**Barkeeper**  
Y'know, I heard Rufus rushed back to headquarters in Midgar...

**Man at Table**  
How long's that guy gonna be in the bathroom? I need to go too...

Back outside...

**Redhead**  
Oh, it's you? I heard you and the Captain really made a BANG\!  
I also heard that Rufus was so pissed off he went on a rampage and that no one's been able to get near him\!

**Mechanic**  
I heard Tiny Bronco broke...  
That sucks. I was secretly eyeing that thing. Broke, huh? What a drag.

**Old Man**  
Because those Shinra creeps locked us up in our houses, we couldn't even watch the rocket lift off.  
I never thought that my only hobby would be destroyed by that arrogant young Rufus...\!

At Cid's house, Shera is working on the car inside.

**Shera**  
I'll take care of everything at home. But please take care of the Captain.

<span id="bone"></span>At Bone Village...

**Excavator**  
Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.  
What do you want?

**Cloud**  
\- Have you seen Sephiroth?  
\- What are you doing?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Have you seen Sephiroth?</span>

**Excavator**  
Oh, the man in a Black Cape. He was looking for the Temple of the Ancients.

**Cloud**  
\- The Temple of the Ancients?

**Excavator**  
It's way down south. It's right on the other side between this town and the inland sea.  
It's the pyramid that rises within the forest.

**Cloud**  
\- How do you get in?

**Excavator**  
You'll need a Keystone.

**Cloud**  
\- What's a Keystone?

**Excavator**  
Just like it sounds. A rock that's a key. I heard that some rich guy has it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What are you doing?</span>

**Excavator**  
We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the planet.

Cloud and the others pass through North Corel on their way to Gold Saucer.

**Man**  
A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'.  
When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head\!\!

**Man 2**  
I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks\!

They take the Ropeway up to Gold Saucer.

**Fortune Telling Machine** (at Wonder Square)  
What you are looking for is near.

<span id="battlesquare"></span>Cloud and the others make their way to Battle Square, which has by now reopened.

**Man**  
I heard that this is the curator's favorite attraction. He likes it so much that he even has his collection displayed in the arena.

**Woman**  
Are you here for the battle, too?

**Cloud**  
\- That's the idea  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That's the idea</span>

**Woman**  
I like fighters. But hate those who're all talk.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Woman**  
Is that so.

</div>

Cloud continues on up the steps.

**Black-haired Man**  
Crap\! I still don't have enough points.  
Mmm? You're new here, aren't you? Then, you want an explanation of the Battle Arena?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Not interested

**Black-haired Man**  
You fight here and collect battle points. You can then exchange those points for prizes.  
The Battle Game... even though it's a game you still use all your physical abilities. To participate, go to the front and pay yer GP's.  
You can fight in up to eight battles. The more you win, the more battle points you get.  
But, if you lose, you lose all your points. So it's up to you whether or not to fight after each win.  
They also make it harder by givin' out handicaps.  
They decide what handicaps there'll be, and you won't know what you're up against until the battle.  
Oh yeah, once you leave the Battle area, all your battle points will become useless. So watch it.  
Oh, and one other thing. The maximum points you could get is 65000, no more. So if you get that many you should exchange them for something.

If you talk to him again after hearing his explanation...

**Black-haired Man**  
Hmm...  
So, uh, how've things been since then?

**Cloud**  
\- No sweat  
\- They're going

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No sweat</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
Hmm, pretty good.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">They're going</span>

**Black-haired Man**  
Ha ha ha\! Well, good luck.

</div>

**Large Man**  
Maybe I could've made it a little further. It's so hard to know when to stop...  
Man, I knew I should've stopped. But it's so hard to stop...

**Man Practicing Kicks**  
I'm not going to lose this time\!  
All right, it should be my turn comin' up here soon.

**Registration Lady**  
Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened\!  
Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.  
The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived.

**Barret**Dyne......

**Registration Lady**  
Register for battle? The registration fee is 10 GP.

**Cloud**  
\- Let's do it  
\- Not interested

**Registration Lady**  
This is a one-on-one battle. Which one of you will participate?

After selecting a party member:

You can engage in up to eight battles. Be aware the more battles you engage in, the greater the handicap, and stronger the Monsters will become.

> **Cloud**  
> Well, I guess I'll enjoy a few battles.

**Points Machine**  
Welcome. You currently have X battle points.  
Would you like to exchange them?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- No, thanks

**Points Machine**  
Thank you very much. Please remember, your battle points become invalid once you leave the Battle Arena.

**Staff Person**  
Whenever you come to the Gold Saucer, I recommend you visit the owner's museum at least once.

<span id="keystone"></span>Cloud enters Dio's Show Room. Various items rest on pedestals around the room, with plaques labeling them.

**Item Plaques**  
"Star Cup"  
"Weekend Clock"  
"Laugh Sapling"  
"Slayer's Pot"  
"Chisa's Mask"  
"Dio's Portrait"  
"D Type Equipment"  
"Zauger's Cup"  
"Calling Gourd"

In the center display is the Keystone.

**Cloud**  
It's the Keystone...

Dio enters from behind him.

**Dio**  
Heh, heh, heh. Long time no see, my boy. Hmm? You like that, huh?

**Cloud**  
Can you let me borrow this?

**Dio**  
Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.  
Hmm.  
Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition.

**Cloud**  
One condition?

**Dio**  
Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me\!

**Cloud**  
\- What'd you want me to do?  
\- Not in the mood

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What'd you want me to do?</span>

**Dio**  
Hoo boy\!  
Heh, heh, heh. It's not something that's really difficult.  
This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just you, my boy. I'm expecting a good fight\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not in the mood</span>

**Dio**  
I see... Then let's pretend that this never happened.

</div>

When Cloud takes him up on the deal, he enters the Battle Arena.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If he completes all 8 battles...</span>

**Dio**  
Heh, heh, heh\! Well done, young man\! All right, as I promised,  
you can take it. Oh, and I'll give you this too.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Protect Vest"

</div>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Choco Feather"\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If he does fairly well...</span>

**Dio**  
Hmm, you did pretty well, young man\!  
Good, it's a promise, so go ahead and take it. I'll give this to you too.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Protect Vest"

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If he does poorly...</span>

**Dio**  
That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go ahead, take it.

</div>

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Keystone"\!

</div>

**Dio**  
Well then, we shall meet again\! Heh, heh, heh.

When trying to leave Gold Saucer with the keystone, Cloud is intercepted by a staff member.

**Staff**  
Excuse me, sir.  
I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now.

**Cloud**  
...so?

**Staff**  
I'm really sorry\!  
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cait Sith is not in the party, he bounces up to join Cloud now.</span>

**Cait Sith**  
What's wrong?

Cloud explains.

</div>

**Cait Sith**  
Too bad. It happens, though.  
I know\! Let's stay at the hotel\! They know me here. I'll go talk to them.

**Staff**  
I will let you know once the repairs are completed.

<span id="meeting"></span>At the hotel, the entire team gathers in the lobby.

**Cait Sith**  
We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?  
Cloud, how 'bout it? Can you tell us what's happened so far?  
I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning.

**Cid**  
Yeah\! I'm all for it\!

**Vincent**  
Good idea.

**Barret**  
I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.  
Cloud, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us\!

**Cloud**  
\- I'm tired...  
\- All right, I'll give it a shot...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'm tired...</span>

**Cid**  
All we have to do now is sleep\! You're still young\! What're you complaining about?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">All right, I'll give it a shot...</span>

Nothing special happens.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Phew...  
We are going after Sephiroth.  
Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land.

**Cid**  
The Promised Land?

**Cloud**  
A land full of Mako energy. ...or at least that's what the Shinra believe.  
I don't know if it actually exists.

**Aeris**  
The Cetras return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.

**Barret**  
Cetra? That some kinda disease?

**Aeris**  
That's what the Ancients call themselves.  
Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?

Barret scratches his head.

**Aeris**  
...You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.  
You search and travel, until you feel it. Like you just know, '...this is the Promised Land.'

**Cloud**  
Aeris... can you feel it too?

**Aeris**  
I think so.

**Tifa**  
So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?

**Aeris**  
That, and one other thing he's searching for.

**Cloud**  
The Black Materia...

**Cait Sith**  
I heard from Dio that a man in a Black Cape was lookin' for the Black Materia.

**Tifa**  
I don't even know what the Black Cape is...  
How many men with Black Capes and number tattoos are there?

**Nanaki**  
...you know, of course... My tattoo is number 13.

**Cloud**  
How did you get that tattoo?

**Nanaki**  
...Hojo put it on me. Everything else is just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo.

**Tifa**  
So there are at least 13\!?

**Aeris**  
...You know......  
I think Hojo did something to those men in the Black Capes.  
But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though...  
That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.

**Barret**  
Yeah, me too\! It's all just too damn confusin'.

**Aeris**  
And...  
I'm sorry, forget it\!  
I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.

She runs upstairs.

**Cait Sith**  
What was that, all of a sudden\!?

**Yuffie**  
What\!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed\!

She runs off after Aeris.

**Cait Sith**  
Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?

**Cloud**  
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.

**Barret**  
Now all we gotta do is take action\! We're startin' tomorrow\!\!

He runs upstairs.

**Nanaki**  
Cloud...  
I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?

**Tifa**  
I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?

**Nanaki**  
But...

**Tifa**  
Be strong.

**Nanaki**  
But, I...

**Tifa**  
Stop it, Nanaki\! Be strong\!

**Cloud**  
Tifa?

**Tifa**  
You're not the only one who's worried\!

**Cait Sith**  
I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation...

**Vincent**  
Hey Cid, let's go back to our rooms.

**Cid**  
...zzzz... zzzz...

Cloud retires to his room. There comes a knock on the door.

**Aeris**  
You want to go on a date?

**Cloud**  
What?

**Aeris**  
A DA-TE\! Or haven't you ever gone on one?

**Aeris**  
Oh well, come on let's go...

She runs around behind him and starts pushing him out of the room.

**Cloud**  
Hey\!

Upon arriving together at the Station...

**Man**  
Tonight's Enchantment Night\! All the attractions are free.  
How 'bout it you two? There's going to be an entertaining show in Event Square\!

**Aeris**  
Come on, let's go.

<span id="aevent"></span>The two of them head for Event Square, where they are greeted immediately.

**Man**  
Congratulations\!\!  
You are our 100th couple today\!\!  
You two will be the leads in tonight's show\!\!\!\!

**Cloud**  
Wha?

**Man**  
Oh, now, it's not hard. Just play it however you want to and the rest of the cast will cover up for you.  
Come this way.

**Cloud**  
H, hey\!

**Aeris**  
This sounds like fun. Come on Cloud, let's do it.

She runs off after the man. Cloud shrugs and follows. The show opens to an empty stage and the narration begins.

**Narrator**  
Long, long ago...  
An evil shadow appeared over the peaceful kingdom of Galdia...  
Princess Rosa was just kidnapped by the Evil Dragon King, Valvados. What will become of her?  
Just then, the legendary hero, Alfred, appears\!\!

**Knight**  
Oh...... You must be the legendary hero...Alfred\!

Cloud shakes his head, staring out at the audience.

**Knight**  
Hey, it's your line.

Cloud points to himself incredulously.

**Knight**  
Yeah, you.  
Ahem\!  
Oh...... You must be the legendary hero... Alfred\!  
I know in my soul. Please... please save Princess Rosa\!

The way you walk, gesture...  
I think I must have seen him again, in you...

...what?

**Tifa**  
Aeris would be able to just come out and say it, probably.  
Cloud...?  
Sometimes being old friends is hard.  
I mean, timing is everything.

**Cloud**  
Yeah...

**Tifa**  
Cloud...?  
I......  
........................

The gondola returns to Round Square, and they get off.

**Tifa**  
Cloud I really had fun tonight.

**Cloud**  
By the way, What did you want to say a minute ago...?

**Tifa**  
N, nothing\!  
Nothing...

**Cloud**  
?

**Tifa**  
Oh, look at the time. We should be getting back.

**Yuffie**  
Cloud you up?

**Cloud**  
What's wrong?

**Yuffie**  
Would you...... keep me company for a bit.

**Cloud**  
? Keep you company where?

Yuffie runs around and starts pushing him out of the room.

**Yuffie**  
Just come on.

**Cloud**  
Hey.

Upon arriving together at the Station...

**Man**  
Tonight's Enchantment Night\! All the attractions are free.  
How 'bout it you two? There's going to be an entertaining show in Event Square\!

**Yuffie**  
Cloud, let's go.

<span id="yevent"></span>The two of them head for Event Square, where they are greeted immediately.

**Man**  
Congratulations\!\!  
You are our 100th couple today\!\!  
You two will be the leads in tonight's show\!\!\!\!

**Cloud**  
Wha?

**Man**  
Oh, now, it's not hard. Just play it however you want to and the rest of the cast will cover up for you.  
Come this way.

**Cloud**  
H, hey\!

**Yuffie**  
I don't know what it's all about but sounds kind of cool. Wanna try it, Cloud?

She runs off after the man. Cloud shrugs and follows. The show opens to an empty stage and the narration begins.

**Narrator**  
Long, long ago...  
An evil shadow appeared over the peaceful kingdom of Galdia...  
Princess Rosa was just kidnapped by the Evil Dragon King, Valvados. What will become of her?  
Just then, the legendary hero, Alfred, appears\!\!

**Knight**  
Oh...... You must be the legendary hero...Alfred\!

Cloud shakes his head, staring out at the audience.

**Knight**  
Hey, it's your line.

Cloud points to himself incredulously.

Yeah, you.  
Ahem\!  
Oh...... You must be the legendary hero... Alfred\!

Cloud and Barret get on the gondola. They sit for a while without talking, Barret tapping his foot and both with their arms folded.

Hey foo. What you wanna see fireworks with me for?

**Cloud**  
Not having fun?

**Barret**  
You should've asked one or the other\!

Damn fireworks anyways.

Cloud and his date chase after Cait Sith. Eventually they wind up at Chocobo Square.

**Lady at Entrance**  
Sir, we can't have you doing that\!

**Bystanders**  
What?

Cait Sith runs past Cloud and down the steps of Chocobo Square, where Tseng arrives in a helicopter.

**Cait Sith**  
Hey\! Over here\! The Keystone\!

He throws Tseng the Keystone.

**Tseng**  
Well done.

The helicopter flies off as Cloud and his date catch up to Cait Sith.

**Cloud**  
Hey\!

**Cait Sith**  
W, wait a second. I won't run or hide.  
Yes, I was a spy. I was hired by the Shinra.

**Cait Sith**  
I couldn't help it.  
How 'bout if we continue like nothing ever happened?

**Cloud**  
No way, cat\! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but being a spy\!

**Cait Sith**  
Then, what are you goin' to do? Kill me?  
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.  
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.

**Cait Sith**  
Whoa, I can't tell you my name.

**Cloud**  
We're not gettin' anywhere.

**Cait Sith**  
See? I told you\! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just continue our journey?

**Cloud**  
You think I'm jokin'\!?

**Cait Sith**  
...Alright, yes, I am a Shinra employee.  
But we're not entirely enemies.  
...Something bothers me. I think it's your way of life.  
You don't get paid. You don't get praised. Yet, you still risk your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me...  
It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too good if things ended the way they are now.

> **Aeris**  
> ......And so on, and so on...

> **Yuffie**

**Cloud**  
He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy.  
We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon get real\!\!

**Cait Sith**  
...just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference.  
But I prepared something in case this happened.  
Why don't you listen to this?

Oh, you didn't seem to know this, but...

The Shinra have already been there, but I guess you have to deal with that.

<span id="leaving"></span>Cloud and the others spend the night at Gold Saucer. In the morning, they again gather in the lobby. Cloud is the last to arrive.

**Cait Sith**  
What took you so long, Cloud?  
Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take the Tiny Bronco East towards the sea, we should be able to find it.  
Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?

**Aeris**  
I want to go\! I'm going for sure\!

**Barret**  
Yo\! I'm goin' too, Cloud\! Gotta keep movin'\!\!

**Tifa**  
You know...... no, forget it. Let's go.

**Nanaki**  
I'm so excited, my tail's starting to tingle. Let's go, Cloud\!

**Yuffie**  
I'm startin' to get nervous.

**Cait Sith**  
The Temple of the Ancients is to the east. Shall we go?

**Vincent**  
The Temple of the Ancients... This might be pretty interesting...

**Cid**  
I don't care what's goin' on let's just go\!

Cloud and his chosen party head for the door.

**Cait Sith**  
Then see you later.

**Fortune Telling Machine** (at Wonder Square)  
What you search for is in the Southeast

Cloud and the others leave Gold Saucer to search out the Temple of the Ancients.

When they arrive at the Temple, Aeris walks to the center of the bridge and lies down, pressing her ear against it.

**Aeris**  
This is... the Temple of the Ancients...  
I... I know... I feel it... The knowledge of the Ancients... floating...  
You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it with the strength of will.  
For the future? For us?

**Cloud**  
What are you saying? Do you understand?

Aeris gets up and starts up the stairs, shaking her head.

**Aeris**  
You're uneasy... But happy?  
Because I'm here? I'm sorry... I don't understand.

She runs back to Cloud.

I want to go inside\!

They go up the stairs, where another clone slouches in front of the entrance.

**Clone \#9**  
Key...... stone......  
Open... the door... of the Temple...

**Aeris**  
Look......

> **Barret**  
> It says number 9. He has a tattoo on his neck.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> He's number 9. There's a tattoo.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> He has a tattoo too\! Ummm, I think it's number 9.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Oh\!? It's an number 9 tattoo.
>
> **Vincent**  
> It's a number 9 tattoo.
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey, he's got a tattoo. It says number 9.

<span id="entrance"></span>They enter the Temple to find Tseng slumped at the altar.

**Aeris**  
Hey\! It's Tseng\!

**Cloud**  
Tseng? Of the Turks\!?

**Tseng**  
Uh... I've been had.  
It's not the Promised Land... Sephiroth's searching for...

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth? He's inside\!?

**Tseng**  
Look... for yourself...

He slams his fist against the floor.

Damn...  
Letting Aeris go was the start... of my... bad luck...  
The President... was wrong...

**Aeris**  
You're wrong.  
The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.  
And, I'm not going to help.  
Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won.

She runs over and stands near a pillar with her back to the others.

**Tseng**  
...pretty harsh. Sounds like something... you'd say.

He gets to his feet and limps towards Cloud.

The Keystone... Place it... on... the altar...

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Keystone"\!

</div>

Tseng moves out of the way and sits down against another pillar. Cloud walks to Aeris, scratches his head and turns away.

**Cloud**  
You crying?

Aeris shakes her head.

**Aeris**  
...Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since we were little...  
There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me.

If they step back outside to talk to the clone again...

**Clone \#9**  
Black...... Materia......

Back inside the Temple...

**Tseng**  
I am...... still alive...

Cloud walks up to the altar.

**Cloud**  
Let's put the Keystone in.

He does so, and sinks through the floor into the maze-like Temple interior.

**Aeris**  
Words... feelings... So many of them here.

> **Barret**  
> Damn--\! So this is the Temple of the Ancients\!  
> Oh man, you gotta be kiddin'. This is makin' me dizzy\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> ...sniff... sniff... This place smells good.  
> It smells the same as Cosmo Canyon.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Geeeez\! We got our work cut out for us.  
> This is starting to get me really dizzy...
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Wow, this place is huge\! I'm starting to get bored.
>
> **Vincent**  
> No exits... We can't turn back.
>
> **Cid**  
> Shit\! Shit\! Shit\! What the hell's with this place\!

**Aeris**  
...Cloud\! I know it's going to be tough, but...  
Don't give up\! We can do it\!

Trying to enter a room along the way...

**Cloud**  
Sealed......? That sound brings back memories.

Ahead is a humanoid being which turns and runs farther into the temple. Cloud and the others follow it to a small room.

**Spirit Body**  
Nyum... nyum...

**Aeris**  
Whew\! We finally caught up to you.  
I'm sorry. You waited for me.  
Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.  
They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.  
Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.  
Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.  
Please, talk to me\!  
No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid...?  
Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?

They follow a second Spirit Body into a room farther down, and it sets off a trap of odd-shaped boulders. Once they make it past, the trap deactivates.

**Aeris**  
Phew--- We did it\!

**Cloud**  
Everyone all right? That sure took a lot out of us.

<span id="tseng"></span>There is a flash and Aeris gasps.

**Aeris**  
Oh no... Cloud. Come quick\!\!  
Hurry, this way\!

She runs off and the others follow her to a glowing pool.

**Aeris**  
It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.  
No... not knowledge... consciousness... a living soul...  
It's trying to say something.  
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

She leans down towards the pool.

What?  
What is it?

She gets back to her feet.

...Danger? An evil... consciousness?  
...show? You're going to show me?

<div class="highlight">

The scene changes to another room where Tseng is observing a mural. Cloud and the others stand translucent in the foreground.

**Cloud**  
...What's going on?

**Aeris**  
Wait\! Look\! It's showing us\!

**Elena**  
Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?

**Tseng**  
...I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.

**Elena**  
Be careful, Tseng.

**Tseng**  
Yeah...  
Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?

**Elena**  
Th... Thank you very much.  
If I may be excused...

She runs off, leaving Tseng alone.

**Tseng**  
Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be...

Sephiroth appears in the foreground with Cloud and the others. He seems to look at them, then solidifies in the mural room with Tseng.

**Tseng**  
Sephiroth\!\!

**Sephiroth**  
So you opened the door. Well done.

**Tseng**  
This place... what is it?

**Sephiroth**  
A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients...  
I am becoming one with the Planet.

**Tseng**  
One with the Planet?

An afterimage of Sephiroth breaks away from him while he's talking and stands with arms lifted.

**Sephiroth**  
You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.  
All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom... knowledge...  
I will meld with it all. I will become one with it... it will become one with me.

**Tseng**  
...you can do that?

**Sephiroth**  
The way...... lies here.

He darts forward and slashes Tseng.

Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.  
For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, you will live again as a part of me.

</div>

The scene returns to the viewing pool. Aeris runs around to rejoin the others.

**Aeris**  
Did you see it?

> **Barret**  
> Yeah, I saw it.
>
> **Tifa**  
> ...I saw it.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> I... I saw it.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Oh grossness\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> ...I saw it. Tseng was in bad shape.
>
> **Vincent**  
> An illusion that the Ancients showed...
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey hey\! What's the catch?

**Cloud**  
...Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?

**Aeris**  
Almost there...

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth is here, right?  
No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here.  
I'm taking him out\!

> **Barret**  
> You mean WE are, right?
>
> **Tifa**  
> We're here too, you know.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Don't forget about us\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> I have nothing to do with it. But, I guess I'll lend a hand.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> I wonder if he'll go down that easy?
>
> **Vincent**  
> ......
>
> **Cid**  
> All right\! Guess you youngsters gotta be enthusiastic like that\!

An afterimage of Sephiroth descends from above into the viewing pool. He stands there for time, then flies off. The pool stops glowing.

Cloud and the others continue on to the chamber of the Time Guardian, a circular, almost bottomless room with hands like a clock face. Around it are the entrances to twelve rooms.

**Time Guardian**  
I am the Time Guardian. Ye who seek the knowledge of the Ancients. I control the time, select your path.  
...it is time... You may proceed.

If the second hand knocks them off as they try to cross, Cloud and the others land in a torch-lit chamber below.

**Aeris**  
This atmosphere...

> **Barret**  
> Feels like a battle\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Here it comes\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> I'm tingling with excitement.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Oh man\! I should've stayed at home.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> It's a battle\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> A battle...
>
> **Cid**  
> Let's do it\!

Cloud and the others fight a pair of Ancient Dragons, then come out through the sealed entrance and make their way back to the Time Guardian. Passages II, IX, and XI are blocked by rubble. Most of the other passages contain valuable items or monsters. Passage XII is the way out, but it seems to be locked.

**Cloud**  
I guess there's no way we can open it... We'll come back later.

Passage VI leads to a room with three levels of doorways, the topmost of which has a more ornate-looking door. Upon seeing Cloud, a Spirit Body locks this door and runs off.

**Aeris**  
Hey\! It's locked.  
No good. We have to catch it\!  
You must be tired.

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- I want to go home

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Aeris**  
Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back at these hard times and laugh.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I want to go home</span>

**Aeris**  
Yeah. But it'll all be over soon\!

</div>

<span id="murals"></span>Cloud catches the Spirit Body and unlocks the door. He and the others enter the room of murals. The murals seem to show a progression, with heiroglyphs scrawled above each image.  
In the first, people are depicted standing outside the Temple. A diamond shape sits within the Temple's center.  
In the second, people may be walking in a procession.  
In the third, they are standing around the altar in the Temple. A diamond shape floats above it.  
In the fourth, they stand near a low table with two jar-like objects on it.  
In the fifth, a woman holds a diamond shape while Meteor falls from the sky.  
In the sixth, people stand around looking in different directions.  
In the seventh, people are dying in flames.

**Aeris**  
This is the room with the murals...

**Cloud**  
Where are you\!? Sephiroth\!\!

Sephiroth appears a ways in front of them.

**Sephiroth**  
So cold.  
I am always by your side.  
Come.

He flies up to the ceiling and disappears.

If Cloud tries to leave the room...

**Cloud**  
Looks like we're locked in.

Sephiroth reappears in front of the mural depicting the altar.

**Sephiroth**  
Splendid.  
A treasure house of knowledge...

**Cloud**  
I don't understand what you're saying\!

Sephiroth laughs and flies off again. Cloud finds him again before the mural depicting Meteor.

**Sephiroth**  
Look well.

**Cloud**  
At what\!?

**Sephiroth**  
At that which adds to the knowledge of...  
I am becoming one with the Planet.

He laughs, flies off, and Cloud finds him sitting slumped in front of the altar.

**Sephiroth**  
...Mother... ...It's almost time.  
Soon... we will become one.

He gets to his feet as Cloud and the others reach him. Aeris steps forward with fists raised.

**Aeris**  
How do you intend to become one with the Planet?

**Sephiroth** (swinging the Masamune)  
It's simple.  
Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury.  
The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury.

He stabs the Masamune into the floor.

...What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet?  
Think how much energy would be gathered\!

He pulls the Masamune from the ground.

Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me.  
All that boundless energy will be mine.  
By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence.  
Melding with the Planet... I will cease to exist as I am now...  
Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.

**Aeris**  
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?  
Injure... the Planet?

**Sephiroth**  
Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic... Meteor.

**Cloud**  
That'll never happen\!

Sephiroth flies off over Cloud's head.

Wake up\!\!

Cloud runs off after him.

**Cloud**  
Where are you\!? Sephiroth\!\!

**Aeris**  
Wait, Cloud\!

She runs after Cloud and finds him standing before the mural depicting Meteor, his body shaking in a double image.

**Aeris**  
Cloud\!\!

> **Barret**  
> Hey\!\! Cloud\!\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hey, Cloud\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Cloud\! What's wrong\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Cloud\! What are you doing?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Cloud\! What's wrong with you\!?
>
> **Vincent**  
> What are you doing?
>
> **Cid**  
> What the hell is going on\!

**Cloud**  
Ha ha ha... Black Materia.  
Ha ha ha... Call Meteor.

**Aeris**  
Cloud\!\! Get a hold of yourself\!

Cloud starts clutching his head.

**Cloud**  
Cloud...  
I'm... Cloud...  
How should I?

He goes through a number of motions typical of Cloud, an afterimage of himself trying to fit together with him. Eventually they merge.

...I remember\! I remember my way.

He turns to Aeris, trying to look nonchalant.

**Aeris**  
...Cloud.

**Cloud**  
Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?

**Aeris**  
...It's nothing so don't worry about it.  
Right, Cloud\! It's nothing.

Barret looks at her oddly, but says nothing. Tifa nods. Nanaki and Vincent look pensive. Yuffie and Cait Sith shrug. Cid scratches his head.

**Aeris**  
Sephiroth got away.

**Cloud**  
...Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.  
So this must be Meteor, right?

They all look at the mural.

> **Barret**  
> Is it some sort of a disaster?  
> It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Is something going to fall from the sky?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Something's going to fall down?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> I don't know what it is but...  
> It looks like it's going to make a mess...
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Then, we got trouble.  
> Oh, so something's going to fall from the sky? It's going to be something big.
>
> **Vincent**  
> Something huge is falling from the sky?
>
> **Cid**  
> I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?  
> Hmpf\! It's not even an omen.

**Aeris**  
...this must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.  
The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.  
It finds small drifting planets with its magic.  
And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely...

The Temple starts quaking.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth\!?

**Sephiroth**  
Ha ha ha... It is not me.

Cloud and the others fight off a Red Dragon.

**Cloud**  
Any sign of Sephiroth?

**Aeris**  
He disappeared.

If they try to leave the room...

**Cloud**  
We're locked in.

They approach the altar.

**Cloud**  
What is this?

**Aeris**  
...There's something written on it.  
...B.l.a.c.k...... M.a.t.e.r.i.a.

**Cloud**  
Black Materia\!\!

**Aeris**  
Hey\!  
...Black Materia.  
What should we do, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- Shake it  
\- Take it  
\- Leave it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Shake it</span>

The Temple quakes.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Take it</span>

The Temple quakes.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Leave it</span>

Cloud shrugs.

</div>

**Aeris**  
Wait a minute. I'll ask\!

She runs a little ways away from the others.

I don't understand......  
What?  
Really\!?

She rejoins Cloud.

They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.

**Cloud**  
What do they mean?

**Aeris**  
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?

**Cloud**  
This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia\!?  
Then no one could take it.

**Aeris**  
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.  
And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.  
As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too.  
Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.

**Cloud**  
So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?

**Aeris**  
Yes, but there's one thing...  
You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.  
So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.

**Cloud**  
I see... the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily...

> **Barret**  
> Then just leave it.  
> If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Let's just leave it, OK?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> That'll be safer. If no one can else take it......  
> Then Sephiroth can't either, right?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it.
>
> **Vincent**  
> I guess that means it's safe here.
>
> **Cid**  
> Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?

**Cloud**  
No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.  
Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.  
It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia.  
This place isn't safe.

He taps the altar, and the Temple shakes.

**Aeris**  
So what are we going to do?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight"><span id="cait"></span>If Cait Sith is in the party...</span>

Cait Sith steps forward.

**Cait Sith**  
I heard your situation\!  
Don't forget about me.  
Everything you said makes perfect sense\!  
You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.

**Cloud**  
We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia.  
And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.

**Cait Sith**  
So that means you don't trust me?  
But Cloud. There's really nothing else you can do.  
Everyone, please trust me.

**Cloud**  
\- I guess we have no choice  
\- No way

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I guess we have no choice</span>

**Cait Sith**  
All righty then\! Leave it all to me\!  
Everyone, hurry up and get outside\!  
I'll go with you to a safe place.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No way</span>

**Cait Sith**  
You sure are stubborn, Cloud.  
Please believe me, Cloud.

**Cloud**  
\- Hmmm, I guess I have to  
\- How can I?

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cait Sith is not in the party...</span>

Cloud's PHS rings, and after a moment of confusion he answers it.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

**Cait Sith**  
Hi, Cloud. This is Cait Sith.  
I overheard the whole story\!  
Don't forget about me.

I'll be waiting at the exit\!

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No way</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

**Cait Sith**  
You sure are stubborn, Cloud.  
Please believe me, Cloud.

</div>

**Cloud**  
\- Hmmm, I guess I have to  
\- How can I?

</div>

</div>

Eventually Cloud has to agree. They make for the exit through the XII passage. Cloud knocks on the door, then turns around and shrugs.

**Cloud**  
It's warm...  
This isn't good...

The others back up as a monster comes through the wall.

**Aeris**  
Cloud...... behind you.

Cloud turns to look and then runs to join them. They fight the Demons Gate, and afterward, the door opens.

**Cait Sith**  
Sorry to keep you waiting\!\! It's Me\!\!

If he was in the party already, he does not say the above line.

I'll handle the rest\!  
Well, everyone... Take care of yourselves\!

**Aeris**  
Cait Sith...  
Come on, Cloud... Say something.

**Cloud**  
I'm not good at this.

**Cait Sith**  
Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.

**Aeris**  
Why don't you read our fortunes?

**Cait Sith**  
Say, that's right... I haven't done it in a while, huh?  
I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me  
Now, what should I predict?

Aeris moves to stand close beside Cloud.

**Aeris**  
Hmm, let's see how compatible Cloud and I are\!

Tifa turns away with a hmph and then turns back.

**Cait Sith**  
That'll cost ya. Exactly one date\!  
Here I go\!

He turns away.

This isn't good. I can't say it.  
Poor Tifa.

Aeris runs up to him.

**Aeris**  
No\! Tell me\!  
I promise I won't get mad\!

**Cait Sith**  
Is that so? Then I'll tell you.  
Looks good. You are perfect for each other\!  
Aeris's star and Cloud's star\! They show a great future\!  
Cloud, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher... I'll do whatever you want me to\!  
You just call me when it all happens\!  
Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.  
This is the final, final farewell\!

He bounces off.

**Aeris**  
Be strong Cait Sith\!\!

Cait Sith returns alone to the room with the murals.

**Cait Sith**  
She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.

He trips and falls.

Owwww......

He carefully gets back up and waves his arms.

What happened?

He bounces around.

I can still move more.

He continues to the altar.

This must be it\!  
The Ancients sure did a great job making this.  
I can protect the Planet too\! I'm kinda embarrassed...  
There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's only one me\!  
Don't forget me even if another Cait Sith comes along.  
Good bye, then\! I guess I'm off to save the Planet...

<span id="blackmateria"></span>Outside the Temple, Cloud and the others watch as it rumbles and shrinks. They run to the deep pit where the Temple used to be, and down at the bottom is a black orb.

**Cloud**  
That's the Black Materia...

> **Barret**

> I'll be looking around here.
>
> **Cid**  
> I'm gonna have a smoke out here\!  
> Ahhh\!\! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this.

Cloud nods and starts down. Aeris follows behind him.

**Cloud**  
As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.

<div class="highlight">

Got Key Item "Black Materia\!"

</div>

**Cloud**  
Mmm?  
Can you guys use it?

**Aeris**  
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.

**Cloud**  
You mean lots of Spiritual energy?

**Aeris**  
That's right.  
One person's power alone won't do it.  
Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy...  
Oh yeah\!  
The Promised Land\!\!

**Cloud**  
The Promised Land\!\!  
No, but...

**Aeris**  
Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.

**Cloud**  
He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.

Sephiroth appears hovering above the pit.

**Sephiroth**  
...Ah, but I have.  
I'm far superior to the Ancients.  
I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients.  
I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients.  
And soon, I will create the future.

**Aeris**  
I won't let you do it\! The future is not only yours\!

**Sephiroth**  
Ha, ha, ha... I wonder?  
Wake up\!

**Cloud**  
Sh... shut up\!

Sephiroth joins them at the bottom of the pit.

**Cloud**  
The... Noise...

**Sephiroth**  
There, Cloud... good boy.

Cloud falls to his knees, then gets up. Time slows as he runs towards Sephiroth. A child Cloud appears there with them and tries to stop Cloud, to no avail.

**Cloud**  
Wa...... aaaa...... aaa...

**Little Cloud**  
No......\!  
Don't be afraid--\!

<div class="highlight">

Gave "Black Materia" to Sephiroth\!

</div>

**Sephiroth**  
......Well done.

He flies off.

**Aeris**  
Cloud, are you all right?

**Cloud**  
...I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth...?

He falls at Aeris's feet.

Wha... what did I do... tell me, Aeris.

**Aeris**  
Cloud... be strong, OK?

He writhes and clutches his head.

**Cloud**  
Urrrrrrgh... What have I done\!?

**Aeris**  
Cloud... you haven't done anything.  
It's not your fault.

**Cloud**  
I...\! I'm-----\!

He shoves Aeris to the ground and starts attacking her.

The one on watch starts down into the pit just as another Cait Sith arrives.

**Little Cloud**  
Waaaa\~\!\!  
What are you doing\!?

**Cait Sith**  
Oops\! This looks like I came at a bad time\!  
I'm Cait Sith No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all\!

If no one else is there, he goes down into the pit.

They knock Cloud out.

---

<span id="aeris"></span>The screen goes white.

**Cloud**  
Everything is white...  
What did I do? I don't remember anything...  
My memory... since when...? If everything's a dream, don't wake me.

The scene changes to the Sleeping Forest. Aeris peeks out from behind a tree.

**Aeris**  
Cloud, can you hear me?

**Cloud**  
Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened.

**Aeris**  
Don't worry about it.

**Cloud**  
...I can't help it...

**Aeris**  
Oh...  
Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?  
And let me handle Sephiroth.

She laughs.

And Cloud, you take care of yourself.  
So you don't have a breakdown, okay?

She walks back behind the tree, and then both of them drop down from the canopy. Cloud looks around.

**Cloud**  
What is this place?

**Aeris**  
This forest leads to the City of the Ancients... and is called the Sleeping Forest.  
It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.  
That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.

She walks a ways down the path.

The secret is just up here.  
At least it should be. ...I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.

She waves.

Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over.

**Cloud**  
Aeris?

She runs off. Cloud tries to follow, but only runs in place. Aeris disappears into the light.

**Sephiroth**  
Hmm...... She's thinking of interfering? She will be a difficult one, don't you think?

He drops down from the canopy.

**Sephiroth**  
We must stop that girl soon.

Cloud wakes to find himself in the Gongaga inn.

### Gongaga - Afraid to Go On

---

Cloud wakes in the Gongaga inn. Barret and Tifa are at his bedside.

**Barret**  
You look like you was havin' a nightmare.  
How are you feeling?

**Cloud**  
\- I seem to be OK  
\- Not good  
\- Don't really know

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I seem to be OK</span>

**Barret**  
That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not good</span>

**Barret**  
Oh... Better keep it to yourself.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't really know</span>

**Barret**  
I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.

</div>

**Tifa**  
You know, Cloud. Aeris is gone.

**Barret**  
Everyone's out looking for Aeris.

Cloud sits up.

**Cloud**  
......City of the Ancients. Aeris is headed there.

**Barret**  
By herself\!? Why did she go by herself\!?  
Hey, we're goin' too.

**Cloud**  
Only the Ancients, only Aeris can save us from Meteor...

**Tifa**  
Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to Aeris? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth... already knows.

**Barret**  
Hey\! Why are you still sittin' around?

**Tifa**  
Let's go, Cloud.

**Cloud**  
No.

He clutches his head.

I might lose it again.  
If Sephiroth comes near me  
I might......

**Barret**  
Yeah, godammit\! It's 'cuz of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault\!

**Cloud**  
My fault?

**Barret**  
I know you got problems... hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.  
But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, we came this far... Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?

**Cloud** (shaking his head)  
No...  
I'm afraid.  
If this keeps up, I may go crazy\!  
I'm afraid...

**Barret**  
Just a damn jackass, that's what you are...  
Yo, jes' think about it... How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?  
People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.  
But, they go on living. They don't run away... Isn't that how it is?

He walks out of the room.

**Tifa**  
Cloud... you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.

She walks out after Barret.

**Cloud**  
What... am I supposed to do?  
Pull out of here?  
Pull out? ...To where?

**Tifa** (from the next room)  
Cloud...

**Barret**  
Wait a minute, Tifa. Give him a little time.  
He has to decide this on his own.  
You believe in Cloud... right?

He leaves the inn, and Tifa follows reluctantly.

**Cloud**  
......I'm afraid to find out the truth...? But...... why?

He gets to his feet.

**Innkeeper**  
You awake?  
Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.  
You sure do have good friends.

Cloud walks outside.

**Tifa**  
Cloud...

**Barret**  
Hey, how are you?  
I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?  
You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?  
Either way, you stay around here and about all you can do is worry about it.  
Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth... If it happens, it happens.  
I'll go upside your spikey white head and bring you back to normal\!

**Tifa**  
Cloud, it'll be all right. We're all with you.

**Cloud**  
But...

**Barret**  
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.

**Cloud**  
...You're... right. ......He's right, isn't he?

**Tifa**  
Come on, let's go and find Aeris...?

Together, they leave Gongaga to search for Aeris.

### Bone Village - A Town of Excavators

---

Cloud and the others arrive at Bone Village.

**Excavator**  
Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.  
What do you want?

**Cloud**  
\- Where is the City of the Ancients?  
\- Do you know where Aeris is?  
\- What are you doing?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Where is the City of the Ancients?</span>

**Excavator**  
The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Do you know where Aeris is?</span>

**Excavator**  
Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went into the Sleeping Forest anyway.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What are you doing?</span>

**Excavator**  
We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the planet.

</div>

**Excavator 2**  
Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that.

**Excavator 3**  
You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp.  
Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you.  
The girl in pink that just went in also used a Lunar Harp to get through.

**Cloud**  
\- I want a Lunar Harp

**Excavator 3**  
Ask the guy in the tent below.

**Excavator 4**  
We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We simulate earthquakes by using bombs, and then check the sound waves given off by the tremors.

**Excavator near Forest**  
The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right now the forest is asleep and anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, it confuses. You can go in, but you may never come out...  
But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a Black Cape went in. You think they'll be all right?

**Head Excavator**  
The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could excavate it for you if you want us to.

**Cloud**  
\- Start diggin'

**Head Excavator**  
It's not just the Lunar Harp you're after. What else are you having us dig for?

**Cloud**  
\- Lunar Harp  
\- Good treasure  
\- Normal treasure

**Head Excavator**  
All right\! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where you want us to dig\!

The excavators eventually retrieve the Lunar Harp, and Cloud heads into the Forest.

### The City of the Ancients - Aeris's Sacrifice

#### [Aeris's Death](#death)

#### [Cloud's Resolution](#resolution)

---

<span id="search"></span>Cloud and the others reach the City of the Ancients, a forebodingly deserted place. Going too far north along the path causes Cloud's companions to stop him.

> **Barret**  
> Hey yo\! Wait up.  
> That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find Aeris.

> **Cid**  
> H...ey, Cloud.  
> You thinkin' of going skiing? If we wanna find Aeris, we go THAT way\!

After exploring the city and finding it empty, Cloud and the others enter the one shell house that's still in tact. Cloud touches one of the glowing orbs.

**Cloud**  
...Ugh.  
...Words of the Ancients?  
...no good. I can't understand.  
...Ugh, again?  
This stream of consciousness... Could this be the words of the Ancients...?

Upstairs, there are several beds.

> **Barret**  
> heh, there's a bed.

They go to sleep, but Cloud wakes in the middle of the night.

**Cloud**  
I feel it...

**Cloud**  
Aeris is here.  
...and so is Sephiroth.

**Cloud**  
...right. Let's hurry and find Aeris.

They go down the path from the house a ways and Cloud stops.

**Cloud**  
Aeris's voice...... Coming from there?

<span id="death"></span>They go to the shell house near the lake and find a hidden stairway down to the altar where Aeris is praying. Cloud and the others stop on the platform below the stepping-stone pillars.

**Cloud**  
Aeris?

He starts up on his own, gesturing for the others to stay back. Upon reaching Aeris, he draws his sword and moves to attack her, despite struggling to stop himself.

**All**  
Cloud\!

> **Barret**  
> Stop it\!\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Stop\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> What are you doing\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Sto----p\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> What are you doing\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> Stop it\!
>
> **Cid**  
> Dumb \#^%@\!

Their voices stop him and he shakes his head, lowering his sword and stepping back.

**Cloud**  
Ugh... what are you making me do.

Aeris looks up from her prayer with a smile, and Sephiroth leaps down from above to impale her. As he pulls the Masamune back out of her, the White Materia comes loose from her hair and bounces down the steps. Cloud moves to take Aeris in his arms as she falls.

**Cloud**  
...Aeris.

He shakes her.

This can't be real\!

**Sephiroth** (arms raised)  
Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's energy.  
All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for me over the snowy fields.  
There, I will become a new being by uniting with the planet. As will this girl......

**Cloud**  
...Shut up.  
The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing.  
Aeris is gone.  
Aeris will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry...... or get angry......  
What about us...... what are WE supposed to do?  
What about my pain?  
My fingers are tingling.  
My mouth is dry.  
My eyes are burning\!

Sephiroth lowers his arms.

**Sephiroth**  
What are you saying? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings too?

Cloud stands and turns to face Sephiroth.

**Cloud**  
Of course\! Who do you think I am\!?

**Sephiroth**  
Ha, ha, ha...... Stop acting as if you were sad.  
There's no need to act as though you're angry either.

He pushes off the floor to hover several feet above Cloud.

Because, Cloud. You are...

Sephiroth flies off, and Cloud and the others are left to fight Jenova∙LIFE.

**Jenova**  
Beacause, you are...... a puppet.

**Cloud**  
I'm....... a puppet?

Barret looks at Aeris, shoulders slumped, shakes his head, touches Cloud's shoulder, and walks off.  
Tifa kneels to trace Aeris's face with her hand and then runs off crying.  
Nanaki looks at Aeris, shakes his head, howls, and pads down the stairs.  
Yuffie clasps her hands and bows her head. She walks to Cloud, and he holds her while she cries. Eventually she calms and runs off.  
Cait Sith looks at Aeris, then at Cloud. He does a half-hearted dance, then leaves with his head lowered.  
Vincent looks at Aeris, then at Cloud, and walks away.  
Cid looks at Aeris, sighs, and leaves.  
Once everyone has said goodbye, Cloud lifts Aeris and carries her to the lake, where he lets her body sink into the water.

<span id="resolution"></span>Cloud and the others stand in the shell house where they slept earlier.

**Cloud**  
Everyone, listen to me.  
I'm Cloud, ex-SOLDIER, born in Nibelheim.  
I came to settle up with Sephiroth.

...To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself.  
...There is a part of me that I don't understand.  
That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth.  
If you hadn't stopped me, Aeris might have been...  
...There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me.  
That's why I should quit this journey.  
Before I do something terrible.

He makes a fist and shakes his head slowly.

But I am going.  
He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed Aeris, and is now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive... Sephiroth.  
I... I must go on.  
...I have a favor to ask of you.  
Will you all come with me?  
...to save me from doing something terrible.

> **Barret**  
> ...I dunno, man...

> **Tifa**  
> ...But, Cloud.

> **Nanaki**  
> ...All right, Cloud.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Leave it to me\!

> **Cait Sith**  
> Watch you?...... We're all in this together\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> ...I guess so.

> **Cid**  
> Well, we'll face it when it happens.

**Cloud**  
I don't know how Aeris tried to save the planet from the Meteor.  
And I guess now, we'll never know.  
But\!  
We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses it.  
Let's go.

Cloud leads the way from the shell house and they walk down the path a ways.

> **Barret**  
> Which way'd that damn foo' Sephiroth go?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Sephiroth... I wonder which way he went?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Sephiroth... Which way did he go?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Ummm... Which way did that Sephiroth guy go?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> I wonder which way Sephiroth went?
>
> **Vincent**  
> Which way did Sephiroth head?
>
> **Cid**  
> ...Which way did that creep Sephiroth go\!?

**Cloud**  
...ugh.

He sees a flickering image of Sephiroth walking the path to the north.

> **Barret**  
> Hey, you awright?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Cloud\! Get a hold of yourself\!\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> You all right?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Wait\! Get a hold of yourself\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Cloud\! Are you all right?
>
> **Vincent**  
> ...you all right?
>
> **Cid**  
> Ey, hey\! You alright?

**Cloud**  
Hmmm...  
Sephiroth said to me... Head North............ past the Snow Fields......

They follow the path northward through Corral Valley Cave and out into the snow fields, after Sephiroth.

<span id="explore"></span>After crossing the snow fields, Cloud and the others reach Icicle Inn.

**Girls Building a Snowman**  
It's almost finished\!  
Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one.

In the Weapons Shop...

**Little Girl**  
Grandpa, wake up\! We have a customer\!\!

**Old Man**  
...smack... mff... Oh... welcome, glad you came.

**Old Man** (on speaking to him again)  
You'll have a hard time selecting from all the good things we have\!

Inside the large house...

**Old Woman in Rocking Chair**  
My husband left 20 years ago and still hasn't come back.  
He should at least be at the foot of the Gaea Cliffs. It's marked with a check on the map...

**Young Woman**  
Grandma, don't sleep so close to the fire\!

**Old Woman in Rocking Chair**  
I just get s-o comfortable.

**Young Woman**  
The master is an experienced climber, you know.  
I've heard that he knows every corner of that Great Glacier\!

**Man in Yard**  
It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a map.  
If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd better take that map on the wall.

If Cloud has already taken the map...

What nerve\! You already tore down the map.

Cloud takes the map on the wall and leaves the house. Inside Icicle Inn...

**Black Surfer**  
You heard about the gnarly hill in this town? They tell me it's off limits\!

**White Surfer**  
What luck\! We came all this way... crap\!

**Woman**  
We came from Costa del Sol to snowboard, but we're just about to leave\!

**Man by Furnace**  
Phew, what is it? Don't get too close, or it'll burn ya.

**Innkeeper**  
It's colder than usual today...  
It's 200 gil, you wanna spend the night?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Enjoy your stay\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Innkeeper**  
Please come again.

</div>

Inside the inn's bar...

**Woman**  
Welcome\! You look like a STRONG one...  
If you want, I could lend you an ear...?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

The woman gets up and sits elsewhere.

**Woman**  
I got bored listening to his stories.

**Man in Overalls**  
Am I boring you?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Woman**  
What's with you\!? You make me sick\!

Note: She will also say the above line if Cloud walks past without talking to her at all.

**Man in Overalls**  
If you go further North, I heard there's a Huge Crater.  
Something huge must've fallen from the sky a long time ago\!

**Woman**  
Oh yeah?

</div>

**Barkeeper**  
I've heard there's a snow woman, at the Great Glacier, that hates hot springs...  
But I think it's just a myth to scare off visitors.

**Redhead**  
I heard some guy went to the Great Glacier in the North.  
What an idiot. Is he thinkin' 'bout going to that hot spring?

**Blond Man**  
He's probably gonna get lost in the glacier and freeze to death.  
No matter how well equipped he is, out there in that cold on the glacier, I give him two days at the most.

**Redhead 2**  
You thinkin' of going North?

**Cloud**  
\- That's my plan  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That's my plan</span>

**Redhead 2**  
Well... if you're going past this town you'll need a map.  
Maybe there's one left at Mr. Holzoff's house. He used to be a mountain climber.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Redhead 2**  
Yeah, we really don't have anything here, but make yourself at home.

</div>

**Man**  
Do you know what a Cetra is?

**Man 2**  
What was the Cetra......? Oh yeah, it's the same as the Ancients, right?

**Man**  
Yeah, a Cetra lived in this town a long time ago.  
Her name was Ifalna, and she knew about a lot of things...

**Man 2**  
Whadaya mean?

**Man**  
I heard she was abducted by the Shinra and was taken somewhere.

**Man 2**  
Shinra and the Ancients... I smell somethin' fishy...

**Man in Bathroom**  
WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT\!?  
You're a real freakazoid, aren't you?

**Woman in Bathroom** (later)  
Eyaaaaaaaaaah\!\!\!

She punches Cloud.

<span id="gast"></span>In exploring the village, Cloud finds a vacant house that once belonged to Professor Gast. There are several videos that Cloud can watch.

- \[The Original Crisis\]

  <div class="highlight-nopad">

  The camera turns on and Gast adjusts the angle to center on Ifalna.

  **Gast**  
  Camera's ready\!  
  Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.

  **Ifalna**  
  2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.  
  The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at the Knowlespole.

  **Gast**  
  Tell us Ifalna... Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?

  **Ifalna**  
  Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.

  **Gast**  
  Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?

  **Ifalna**  
  ...I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a conversation with the Planet...  
  It said something fell from the sky making a large wound.

  She shakes her head.

  Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet...  
  But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal itself, over many years.

  **Gast**  
  Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?

  **Ifalna**  
  No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living things on this Planet becomes the energy.  
  The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to diminish the needed energy...

  **Gast**  
  Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts.  
  Is that because the planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?

  Ifalna lowers her head.

  **Ifalna**  
  Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away the land... then the Planet...  
  The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, but...

  **Gast**  
  Ifalna... Let's take a break.

  She turns to him and shakes her head.

  **Ifalna**  
  I'm all right... When the Cetra... were preparing to part with the land they loved...  
  That's when it appeared\!  
  It looked like... our... our dead mothers... and our dead brothers. Showing us spectres of their past.

  **Gast**  
  Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't any idea.

  **Ifalna**  
  That's when the one who injured the Planet... or the 'crisis from the sky', as we call him, came.

  She buries her face in her hands.

  He first approached as a friend, deceived them, and finally...... gave them the virus.  
  The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad... transforming into monsters.

  She drops to her knees.

  Then, just as he had at the Knowlespole.  
  He approached other Cetra clans...... infecting them with... the virus...

  **Gast**  
  You don't look well... Let's call it a day.

  </div>

- \[What is "Weapon?"\]

  <div class="highlight-nopad">

  **Gast**  
  Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?

  **Ifalna**  
  Yes, Professor.  
  The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra... was named Jenova. That is the 'crisis from the sky'.  
  The Planet knew it had to destroy the 'crisis from the sky'...  
  You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal itself.

  **Gast**  
  Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced of it's own will?

  **Ifalna**  
  Yes, but... There is no record of Weapon ever being used.  
  A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova, and confined it.  
  The Planet produced Weapon... But it was no longer necessary to use it.

  **Gast**  
  So, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?

  **Ifalna**  
  Weapon cannot vanish. ...it remains asleep somewhere on the Planet.  
  Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at some time...  
  The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It is still, watching Jenova.

  **Gast**  
  Where is Weapon?

  Ifalna shakes her head.

  **Ifalna**  
  I don't know...... I can't hear the voice of the Planet well...  
  Times... have changed. The Planet... is probably watching this situation closely.

  She buries her face in her hands. Gast turns away and shakes his head.

  **Gast**  
  ...Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today...

  </div>

- \[Confidential -- Daughter's Record: 10th Day after birth\]

  <div class="highlight-nopad">

  With this recording, there is only dialogue against a black background.

  **Ifalna**  
  What are you doing, Profes...... I mean, honey?

  **Gast**  
  Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video. But, the video's not working right...

  **Ifalna**  
  What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't mentioned?

  **Gast**  
  No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.  
  And when she's sleeping, her face... looks like an angel.

  **Ifalna**  
  First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video later\!

  **Gast**  
  I've already decided\! If it's a girl, then it'll be Aeris. That's that\!

  **Ifalna**  
  You are SO selfish\! But Aeris is a good name\!  
  Hee hee... it's a good name, considering it came out of that forgetful head of yours\!

  **Gast**  
  Right\!? Oh, the video tape......

  </div>

- \[Confidential -- Daughter's Record: 20th Day after birth\]

  <div class="highlight-nopad">

  **Ifalna**  
  Video again? You just got through taping\!

  **Gast**  
  .........Please don't say it that way.  
  It's our lovely daughter, both yours... and mine\!  
  Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?

  **Ifalna**  
  If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be strong...  
  Aeris is different from the other children. I wonder what dangers await her...?

  **Gast**  
  Never say that\! I will protect you and Aeris no matter what\!\!  
  You and Aeris are my only treasures. I'll never let you go\!\!

  **Ifalna**  
  I feel so much better now, darling.  
  If I hadn't met you, I......

  They start to embrace, but there is a knock on the door.

  **Gast**  
  Who could that--I was just about to...  
  Damn\!\!  
  How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together\!

  **Ifalna**  
  I'll send them away.  
  Yes, at once\!\!  
  Who the devil?

  She goes to the door and opens it.

  It, it's them\!\!

  She runs back down the stairs and hides behind Gast. They both back up as two Shinra soldiers enter, followed by Hojo.

  **Hojo**  
  Heh, heh, heh...... I've been searching for you, Ifalna... or should I say, Cetra\!  
  Long time no see, Professor Gast\!

  **Gast**  
  Hojo... How did you know?

  **Hojo**  
  Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.  
  Two years I waited... That's how much I wanted this new sample...... Ha, ha, ha.

  Ifalna buries her face in her hands and Gast shakes his head.

  **Gast**  
  ...New sample? You don't mean Aeris\!?

  **Hojo**  
  Hmm, Aeris? What a nice name...... Ha, ha, ha.

  **Gast**  
  That's it\! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.  
  Hojo, please leave.

  Ifalna moves to kneel at Hojo's feet.

  **Ifalna**  
  Please, Aeris has nothing to do with it\! All you want is me, right?

  **Gast**  
  Ifalna\!

  **Hojo**  
  I'll need all of you for my experiment.  
  You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet\!

  Gast kneels down beside Ifalna.

  **Gast**  
  Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this\!

  **Hojo**  
  Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.  
  Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard\! Destroy it\!

  One of the soldiers turns to shoot out the camera. The video feed fails.

  **Hojo**  
  Be careful with her\!\! Ha, ha, ha......

  **Ifalna**  
  Wh... what are you doing, Professor\!?

  **Gast**  
  Ifalna\! Take Aeris and run\!\!

  There is a gunshot and a thud.

  **Ifalna**  
  Eyaaaaaah... Darling......\!\!

  **Hojo**  
  Oh, and uh... don't forget the child\!  
  Hmm, a video? The Ancients... Weapon\!?  
  Heh, heh, heh... a mountain of treasure\! Thank you Professor... Ha, ha, ha

  </div>

Having seen everything, Cloud leaves Gast's house and heads for the slopes.

**Man in Thicket**  
No, don't\!\! It's a steep downgrade, past here.  
It's dangerous, please don't go\!

**Cloud**  
\- I'm still going  
\- Thanks for your kindness

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'm still going</span>

**Man in Thicket**  
Damn, I was just being nice...  
What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble\!

He runs off.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Thanks for your kindness</span>

**Man in Thicket**  
No, no. I just did what came natural.  
All right, I'm not too busy now. Do you want me to teach you how to ride a snowboard?

**Cloud**  
\- Maybe you should  
\- Not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Maybe you should</span>

A controls diagram pops up.

**Man in Thicket**  
Do you want me to explain again?

\- Yes, please

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Not interested</span>

**Man in Thicket**  
You're so boring\!

<span id="elena"></span>When Cloud says he's still going, Elena enters the village, accompanied by Shinra soldiers.

**Elena**  
There they are, hurry\!\!

**Soldiers**  
Yes ma'am\!\!

Elena and two soldiers run up to Cloud.

**Elena**  
Cloud... huff... wheeze.  
I won't let you go any further\!

**Cloud**  
What's down there?

**Elena**  
It's a SE-CR-ET.  
It really doesn't matter\! But you really got guts doin' my boss in like that\!

**Cloud**  
You mean Boss...... Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it.

**Elena**  
No\! Don't think you can fool me, liar\!

**Cloud**  
I'm not lying... it was Sephiroth.

**Elena**  
Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it\!\!

**Cloud**  
Oh, man...

**Elena**  
Looks like talking alone won't cut it. You're going to have to feel some pain\!

**Soldier**  
Just you... and me\!\!

**Elena**  
No, I can handle him\! There's no way he can avoid my punch.

**Soldier**  
What? Yeah......

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud dodges Elena's punch...</span>

Elena goes rolling past him on down the hill, and the soldiers chase after her.

**Soldier**  
Ele... Elena\!?

**Man in Thicket**  
What the...? They sure were weak for Shinras.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud doesn't dodge...</span>

Elena punches him, knocking him out cold.

**Elena**  
Why? Why didn't you try to avoid it...  
There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.  
Put them in some house in the village.

Cloud wakes in Gast's house.

</div>

Now, Shinra soldiers stand guarding the town's entrance.

**Soldiers**  
This village is now under martial law\!

**Cloud**  
\- (Do what you're told)  
\- (Kick his butt)

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">(Do what you're told)</span>

**Soldier**  
Don't be angry. I'm just doing my job.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">(Kick his butt)</span>

**Soldier**  
Stop it, there're kids around\!  
Listen, I probably shouldn't tell you, but I hear something big's going down up North.  
The President's gonna be there. So, would you please just lay low for a while?

</div>

**Girl Sledding**  
Who is that man?

**Man on Roof of Small House**  
When I first moved here, I saw a man with a Black Cape heading North.  
It seemed strange seeing a Black Cape against the snowy white.

Inside the small house...

**Woman**  
My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here...  
I never should've bought him a snowboard.

**Boy**  
......whimper...... weep...  
I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a while...  
Hey, I'll give you my snowboard.

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Snowboard"\!

</div>

**Boy**  
Tell me when you get good at it.

**Man in Thicket**  
Sorry I just took off a while ago... It looked like there was going to be trouble.  
Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want me to teach you how to ride one?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah, maybe you should  
\- No, not interested

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, maybe you should</span>

**Cloud**  
\- Yes, please  
\- No thanks

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No, not interested</span>

**Man in Thicket**  
All right, big-head... But don't blame me if you get hurt.

</div>

Cloud heads off down the slope.

**Man in Thicket**  
Be careful\!

Or, if Cloud is lacking either the map or the snowboard:

I told you, you can't\!

He physically pushes Cloud back into the village.

You won't make it without a snowboard and a map\!\!

Cloud and the others snowboard down the slopes, finally flying off an edge and falling down into the Great Glacier.

<span id="glacier"></span>Flying off a cliff at the end of the snowboarding slopes, Cloud and the others land in Great Glacier.

**Cloud**  
Ugh...

He gets to his feet.

I guess we're still in one piece.  
Everyone all right?

The others get up.

**Cloud**  
So where did we land?

Depending on the course they took, Cloud will say any of the following:

Seems like it didn't end up being such a big jump...  
Seems like maybe we didn't even jump at all...  
We've jumped pretty far...  
Looks like we've jumped pretty far...

**Cloud**  
It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer.

In the Frostbite Cave...

**Cloud**  
Looks like trouble.  
\- We're outta here\!  
\- Wait a minute\!

Choosing "We're outta here," Cloud does some fancy footwork and ends up outside of Great Glacier entirely.

There is a cave within the mountains where they find a woman in blue. If Cloud speaks to her without going to the hot springs...

**Woman in Blue**  
...Please leave.  
Please don't worry about me.  
Now, I don't want to harm any of you.  
And don't come back again.  
Please stop it.  
Please, that is enough.

At the hot springs...

**Cloud**  
This is the only place not frozen.  
\- Touch it  
\- Let's go on

**Cloud**  
Hmm, a hot spring.

Having gone to the hot springs, Cloud and the others may return to the woman in the mountain cave.

**Woman in Blue**  
Yeeew... You got a lot of nerve trying to touch me with the same dirty hands that touched that filthy hot spring\!  
I'll never forgive you.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they defeat the Snow woman...</span>

**Woman in Blue**  
Why this...?

The woman collapses.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they lose to the Snow woman...</span>

**Woman in Blue**  
Hah, Just remember your place\!

Cloud wakes to find himself in Holzoff's house. If he returns to face her again:

**Woman in Blue**  
Huh, still don't get it, huh?

</div>

Travelling into the northern reaches of the glacier, they end up on seemingly endless snowfields.

**Cloud**  
...Snow... as far as you can see... Better watch where I walk.  
...I'll place a landmark, and start walking.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud makes it to Holzoff's house on his own...</span>

**Holzoff**  
Now, this is a surprise\!\!  
How many years has it been since I last saw anyone here...?  
Oh, excuse me\! My name is Holzoff. I've lived here for 20 years now.  
You mind listening to the stories of a lonely climber?  
Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud collapses before reaching the house...</span>

Cloud wakes to find himself in Holzoff's house.

**Holzoff**  
You awake?  
You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're all right.

Cloud scratches his head.

**Holzoff**  
My name is Holzoff. I've been living here 20 years now.  
If you are planning to head North, you'd better listen to my story.  
Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.

</div>

They go into the next room and sit down.

**Holzoff**  
You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah</span>

**Holzoff**  
The first time my friend Yamski and I tried to climb the cliff was 30 years ago.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Holzoff**  
There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here a long time ago.  
That's what's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed this cliff.  
30 Years ago, Yamski and I took this cliff on to see what was on the other side.

</div>

**Holzoff**  
But, we weren't prepared for it. We did expect the temperature to be low but...  
On that cliff, there's always a biting cold wind. The cold air lowers your body temperature.  
Yamski, was below me. He cut his own rope...  
...and I didn't even notice...  
Ever since then, I've settled here... continuing to challenge the cliff, and provide warning and shelter to my fellow climbers.  
If you're going to climb the cliff, there's 2 precautions you'll need to take.  
First, check your route... It's hard to find because of all the snow.  
Second, once you get to a ledge, make sure you warm yourselves up.  
Understand?

**Cloud**  
\- One more time  
\- Yes

**Holzoff**  
You must've used a lot of energy getting up here... Better get some rest before you head out.

Cloud and the others spend the night. If Cloud speaks to Holzoff again:

**Holzoff**  
To climb this cliff you must check your route.  
And you have to keep your body temperature normal. Don't forget these things.  
Like to rest a little?

**Cloud**  
\- Oh yeah  
\- No, thanks

**Holzoff** (if Cloud answers no)  
Don't over do it.

Everyone gathers outside, facing the cliffs ahead.

**Barret**  
You know, I've been thinkin'...?

**Cloud**  
\- What is it?  
\- Save it for later

**Barret**  
...Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature is.  
But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to... you know...  
I'll tell you one thing though, If I did have to live here I'd change things around 'n' make it better.  
I guess the total opposite of this would be...... Midgar.  
When you think of it that way, Shinra don't seem so bad...  
Uuuuuuurrrrrgh\!\!  
What the hell am I sayin'\!? The Shinra, not bad\!?

**Cloud**  
We'll secure the route. You come up later.

**Barret**  
Y'know... standing here like this...  
Kinda makes you feel like the Planet's not on our side, don't it?  
Of course we can't even compete. I mean... The Planet don't even notice us humans...

**Tifa**  
This blizzard's nothing\! I gotta say that or... brr...

**Nanaki**  
I wonder what's at the top of that cliff? Well we shall see...

**Yuffie**  
Brrrr, I can't take this cold\!\!

**Cait Sith**  
This is secret info, but... Rufus's going to arrive here, too.

**Vincent**  
I wonder what's on the other side of the cliff...

**Cid**  
Damn\! If I could just get back in the air, this cliff would be nothing\!

Cloud and the others scale Gaea's Cliffs. In a tunnel near the top of the cliffs, they come across one of the clones.

**Clone**  
Ugh...... Errgaahh\!\!

It collapses and disappears. Cloud runs through the tunnel and encounters into a two-headed dragon. After defeating it, Cloud and the others continue through the tunnel and reach the top of Gaea's Cliffs. They look over the edge at the crater, and then start down the slope. Cloud pauses a short way down.

<span id="crater"></span>**Cloud**  
An old crater...  
Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here......  
Leaving a scar on the planet.

> **Barret**  
> So all this energy's gathered here for the planet to heal itself?
>
> **Tifa**  
> So the planet has gathered all this energy here to heal itself?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> The energy of the planet is concentrated here.  
> It is slowly healing its old wound.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Even I know what's going on. The energy's bein' gathered here to heal the gash.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> It's trying to heal its wound by gathering all that energy here.
>
> **Vincent**  
> It's amassed a vast amount of energy to heal itself.
>
> **Cid**  
> Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered all that energy to try an' heal itself.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor.  
Next time the wound won't be so small.

They continue down the slope.

**Clone**  
...b, back... to... Sep...... i... roth...

Further down, they come to the edge of Whirlwind Maze.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Tifa is in the party...</span>

**Tifa**  
The time has come to settle things with Sephiroth, huh?

Cloud nods.

**Tifa**  
I, too, have lost many things because of Sephiroth.  
Let's go\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Tifa is not in the party...</span>

**Tifa**  
Cloud, wait for me\!\!  
Please take me with you. You're going to have it out with Sephiroth, aren't you?

Cloud folds his arms in thought, and Tifa turns away.

**Tifa**  
Because of Sephiroth, I, too, have lost many things, so please take me along.  
Don't say no. Okay?......

**Cloud**  
It can't be helped......

One of the others stays behind:

> **Barret**  
> The rest is up to you\!

> **Nanaki**  
> I'm going to call everyone.

> **Yuffie**

> <span id="sephiroth"></span>Beyond the first wind wall, roughly a dozen Sephiroth clones make their way in a line towards the second wind wall, many collapsing before they reach it. Beyond the second wall, Cloud comes upon Sephiroth cutting down the clones.

<span id="dream"></span>The screen is pitch black. Cloud sits in the distance.

**Tifa**  
Cloud...  
Cloud...

Cloud gets up and starts walking away. Tifa runs after him, but he disappears into the black, and she falls to her knees.

**Tifa**  
......I didn't know what to do. I was always like that...

<div class="highlight">

Flashback to the Sector 7 train station, before the events of the game. Cloud is lying near the steps holding the Buster Sword, with the station man and a dog on either side of him.

**Station Man**  
What's the matter?

**Cloud**  
ohhh...

**Station Man**  
......poor kid.

**Cloud**  
Ooouugh......

Tifa runs over, and the station man walks off.

**Tifa**  
Are you all right?

**Cloud**  
oo... uh... agh

Tifa kneels down in front of him, and there's a flash of white.

**Cloud**  
Uh... uh... Tifa...?  
Tifa...?

He gets to his feet, and Tifa stands with him.

**Cloud**  
Tifa\!

**Tifa**  
...............?  
Oh, Cloud\!

**Cloud**  
That's right. I'm Cloud.

**Tifa**  
Is it really you, Cloud? I never thought I'd find you here\!

**Cloud**  
Yeah, it's been a while.

**Tifa**  
What happened to you? You don't look well.

**Cloud**  
......Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay.

She turns away and he clutches his head for a moment. She turns back.

**Tifa**  
How long has it been?

Flash.

**Cloud**  
Five years.

**Tifa**  
............

**Cloud**  
What is it?

**Tifa**  
...it's really been a long time.

</div>

**Tifa**  
Actually, it's been seven years.  
You got your wish and joined SOLDIER, quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a mercenary...  
You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim...  
But...  
...Something's wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about.  
All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did...  
I wanted to make sure...  
But then I heard... you were going far away...  
And I didn't want that...  
...I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.  
And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to be with you, watch you.

<span id="captive"></span>The screen fades to white, and we hear the cries of the Planet. Eventually, Tifa wakes in Junon base to bright lights overhead.

**Tifa**  
...ding......

**Barret**  
Huh?

**Tifa**  
The glare...

**Barret**  
You'll be better soon. You've been asleep for a long time.

**Tifa**  
I'm...... hungry...

**Barret**  
Hey, why don't you ask?

About him.

The glare fades and Tifa sits up.

**Tifa**  
...Because I'm scared.

**Barret**  
Don't worry. I don't know what happened to Cloud either.  
Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry...  
None of them know if he's all right either.

**Tifa**  
He's still... alive, right?

Barret nods.

**Tifa**  
How long... was I asleep?

**Barret**  
Lessee now...... Must've been about 7 days.

**Tifa**  
What about Sephiroth?

**Barret**  
You ain't over it yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave?  
Since then, the crater's been surrounded by a huge barrier of light.  
Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in that big hole, protected by the barrier.  
We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.  
An' on topa that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on a rampage.

**Tifa**  
...Weapon?

**Barret**  
Remember that huge monster that was with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater?  
Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past.

**Tifa**  
Weapon... is protecting Sephiroth?

**Barret**  
Dunno. But he's up here goin' around tearin' shit up.  
Right now Rufus' fightin' it. I hate to say it, but he's got guts.  
We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but we ain't got no time...

**Tifa**  
Time...  
... Hey\! How about Meteor?

Barret presses a button to open the blinds to a large window, revealing Meteor hanging in the sky.

**Tifa**  
Do we have to give up?

**Barret**  
...Dunno.

The door opens and Rufus enters.

**Rufus**  
I thought Cloud would show up to save you all...  
Professor Hojo wanted to check up on Cloud, too.

**Tifa**  
What are you going to do to Cloud?

**Rufus**  
Sephiroth's alter ego...  
Meteor has been summoned... Essentially, it's all but over now.  
So, there's no need for you now.  
No, maybe there is an important task for you...

<span id="execution"></span>Heidegger enters.

**Heidegger**  
President\! Preparations for the public execution are complete.

**Barret**  
Execution\!?  
What're ya gonna get by executin' us?

**Rufus**  
You are to be executed for causing this situation.  
People are ignorant. They'll feel better as long as someone is punished.

**Barret**  
I take back what little praise I had for this damn jackass\!

**Rufus**  
Well, enjoy your last moments together.

He walks out.

**Heidegger**  
I'll tie your arms now.

Shinra soldiers escort Barret and Tifa down to the press room, where Scarlet waits with about half a dozen members of the press.

**Scarlet**  
Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness into the world\!

**Barret**  
The hell are these people?

**Scarlet**  
We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national television.

**Large Man**  
Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?

**Scarlet**  
With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately need to rally public support... it's better that we punish somebody, anybody.

**Tifa**  
You make me sick...

**Scarlet**  
Ha, ha, ha, ha\!  
They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff\!  
We'll start with this girl.

**Barret**  
If you've gotta do it... do me first\!

**Scarlet**  
Camera, this way\! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats up tearful goodbyes\!

A soldier brings Tifa into the gas chamber, and Scarlet pushes her towards the chair.

**Tifa**  
What are you doing\!?

**Scarlet**  
This is my special gas chamber. Take your time, and enjoy a slow painful death.

She shoves Tifa into the chair, and the soldier locks her into it.

**Scarlet**  
Stuck up ^%$\#&\!\!

She slaps Tifa.

Scarlet and the soldier walk out, the soldier dropping a key on the way.

**Scarlet**  
Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha\!

<div class="highlight">

Emergency\! Emergency\!  
Weapon's approaching\! Attention all military personnel: take your positions\!

</div>

**Press Representatives**  
Oh no\! It's Weapon\!  
Run\!

They all flee the press room except for the large man.

**Scarlet**  
Hey, hey, all of you\!  
Damn\! Why now?

**Large Man**  
How does it feel now, Scarlet?

**Scarlet**  
Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right now......  
Nngaaaaaahhhh\!

She collapses.

**Barret**  
Huh\!? Sleeping gas?

The large man reveals himself to be Cait Sith in disguise.

**Soldiers**  
Weirdo\!\!

Cait Sith and Barret dispatch the soldiers.

**Cait Sith** (untying Barret's arms)  
I'm here to help\!

**Barret**  
Why you......? Ain't you part of Shinra?

**Cait Sith**  
Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides... I hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help Tifa.  
I'll keep watch at the entrance.

**Scarlet**  
......Fools...... I've already pushed... the switch...

Barret tugs at the door to the gas chamber.

**Barret**  
It won't open\!

---

<span id="weapon"></span>Meanwhile, in the command center, Rufus and Heidegger stand before a broad window overlooking the ocean.

**Heidegger**  
It's Weapon.

**Rufus**  
There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?

**Heidegger**  
I believe so. Your orders?

**Rufus**  
No need to ask.

**Heidegger**  
We'll give it a shot from our big cannon.  
Open cannon doors\!\! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon\!\!

Three men standing behind Heidegger salute and run off. The cannon moves into position.

**Sailor**  
Preparations complete\!

**Heidegger**  
The cannon...  
Fire----\!\!\!

The cannon fires a shot across the water. A moment of silence descends.

**Rufus**  
Did we get 'em?

**Heidegger**  
Seems so...

<div class="highlight">

Weapon approaching\!  
Speed, 50 Knots\!  
It's heading right toward us\!

</div>

**Heidegger**  
It can't be\! We hit it dead on\!

**Rufus**  
How about the cannon?

**Heidegger**  
It'll take time to reload.

**Rufus**  
Then use regular fire power in the mean time\!

**Heidegger**  
Yes sir\! Open all artillery doors\! Target: Weapon\! Don't let it land\!

Weapon approaches from the ocean amid a hail of fire from Junon's smaller cannons.

<div class="highlight">

Speed, 70 Knots\!  
Weapon, closing in\!\!  
Not good\! It's attacking\!

</div>

---

Back at the gas chamber, the gas turns on and Tifa starts squirming.

**Tifa**  
Gas\!\!  
Barret, help\!\!

**Barret**  
Hold your breath\! Hold on as long as you can\!

**Tifa**  
Come on\! I can't hold on forever\!

**Barret**  
Shi-\!

Barret gives up getting the door open and runs back to Cait Sith.

**Barret**  
The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room\!

**Cait Sith**  
Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this room first.

**Barret**  
Tifa\! I'll help you, I promise\!

They leave the press room, and the door locks behind them.

**Barret**  
No\! They locked this too\!

**Scarlet** (from inside)  
Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.  
Ha, ha, ha, ha\!\!

**Barret**  
Goddammit......\!\!

**Cait Sith**  
OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport\!

**Barret**  
Why the airport? An' leave Tifa there?

**Cait Sith**  
Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance.

If Barret goes the wrong way...

**Cait Sith**  
Where you goin'? The airport's the other way.

They run outside and come across Yuffie disguised as a reporter.

**Yuffie**  
I know you're in a hurry\! But, please if I could have a word......

**Barret**  
Shu'up\!\! I'm in a hurry\!

Kiiiiin...

**Yuffie**  
Don't make so much noise...... It's me, ME\! Yuffie\!

**Barret**  
The hell you doin' here\!?

**Yuffie**  
I'll explain later\! Now we gotta get to the airport\!

If Yuffie has not been recruited, a lone cameraman films the attack as soldiers run past. Barret stops to look as Weapon emerges from the ocean.

**Barret**  
Damn, man\!

They arrive at the airport.

**Barret**  
Yo\! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end\!

**Cait Sith**  
Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?

**Barret**  
You damn cat......\! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon\!  
Yo, better watch my back till the end... partner\!

---

<span id="escape"></span>Back in the gas chamber, Tifa manages to grab the dropped key with her feet and free herself from the chair.

**Tifa**  
Which button stops the gas...?

She turns off the gas and then tries to tug open the door.

Open it---......

Outside, Weapon fires an energy blast at Junon base. The cannon returns fire, and Weapon sinks into the ocean. The exchange leaves a hole in the ceiling above the gas chamber.

**Scarlet**  
What d'you do? Hey\! Open it\!

**Tifa**  
First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind\!

She climbs out the opening, down the outside of the base, and runs out across the cannon. Scarlet follows and they face off near the end of the cannon.

**Scarlet**  
Our little game of hide and seek ends here.  
The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by falling from here and crashing into the water below still might be pretty exciting.

She slaps Tifa.

Stuck up to the end\!

**Tifa**  
Quit slapping me\! You old wench\!\!\!

A slapping fight ensues.

**Tifa** (as she slaps Scarlet)  
What\!?  
Pay back\!\!  
Stop it\!  
Same to you\!\!

**Scarlet** (as she slaps Tifa)  
How can you\!?  
You\!\!  
That hurts\!  
That's enough\!

At the end of the fight, one of them falls down.

**Scarlet** (if she loses)  
God\! I can't stand it\!

**Scarlet**  
Take her away.  
Now it's time to pay up. I'll really drop you if you don't settle down\!  
Ha, ha, ha, ha\!

Run...  
Run to the end of the Cannon\!\!

Tifa runs to the end of the cannon as the airship, the Highwind, comes up from below and hovers nearby. Barret is out on deck, and he throws Tifa a rope. She jumps from the cannon and catches the rope as the Highwind flies away from Junon.

**Barret**  
You okay?

**Tifa**  
My cheeks hurt a bid.  
Forget about that, what's all this about?

**Cait Sith**  
Well, I'll catch the details later.  
In any case, the Airship, Highwind, is now yours.

**Yuffie** (lying on deck)  
Ha\! Ha\! ......urk\!  
Well...... I'm glad you're safe.  
I'm going to stay up here a little longer.  
......Urk\! ......I can't ride ships either in the air or water.

Tifa goes inside.

**Crew Member in Operation Room**  
Sorry\!\! Go speak to Captain Cid\!

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here\!

**Tifa**  
\- Fly Airship  
\- Chew the fat

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fly Airship</span>

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
So things have come to this... When you want to take off, just tell the pilot on the bridge.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Chew the fat</span>

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
......Well......... Um, what should I talk about?  
Wanna hear why we rebelled?

**Tifa**  
\- Listen  
\- Don't care

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.  
Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.  
We put up with this all the time. Even when he beat us.  
I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.  
Let's see, it must've been a week ago... it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.  
Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.  
And with them, I saw Cid, a legendary pilot\!  
And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic......  
He even talked to us.  
I couldn't believe it\! I was so impressed\! He was every bit as warmhearted as we'd always heard.  
Cid said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.  
And now here we are off to save the planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.  
And that's why we decided to help.  
After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire\! Fire\!'  
In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.  
That's how it happened. .......Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.  
But Barret and you were captured by Heidegger......  
We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys, before we finally could.  
So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.  
I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.

</div>

**Crew Member in Chocobo Stable**  
I'm bored...... I'd like to ride a Chocobo.

**Tifa**  
\- How do I?  
\- Later

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">How do I?</span>

**Crew Member in Chocobo Stable**  
Listen...... you gotta ride in on a Chocobo you've raised yourself  
Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, I'll take care of it for you.  
I'll take care of it for you.  
what? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about that.  
If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo ranch near Midgar. You should ask them.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Later</span>

**Crew Member in Chocobo Stable**  
Whew......

</div>

**Barret**  
Dammit\! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship\!?  
I thought...... Tifa was gone for good.

**Cait Sith**  
Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.  
Come on\! Everyone is waiting\!

<span id="crew"></span>**Tifa**  
Everyone? Everyone's here?

Tifa runs to the bridge.

**Cid**  
Welcome to my airship--the Highwind\!

Tifa looks around.

**Cid**  
What's wrong\!? You should be more excited than that\!

**Nanaki**  
Cid......

**Cid**  
Yeah......

**Tifa**  
Not enough crew.

**Pilot in Training (LV3)**  
Yaaaaahh\! Don't talk to me right now\!

**Bridge Crew Member 1**  
Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things up\!

**Bridge Crew Member 2**  
All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us.

**Cid** (after Tifa speaks to either of the crew)  
Hey you\! What the hell are you doin'\!?

**Barret**  
What's that sad face for?

**Cait Sith**  
Tifa, I'll give you information Shinra.  
Ask me if there's anything you don't understand.

**Cid**  
Well, it takes all kinds.

**Nanaki**  
Do you think we aren't strong enough without Cloud?  
Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?

**Tifa**  
Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage......  
At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do......  
No idea at all......

**Barret**  
Get a hold of yourself Tifa\! C'mon, let's think about this\!  
No way we can get offa this train we're on\!

**Tifa**  
......If only Cloud was here, everything would be fine.  
Cloud would......  
Stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.  
He'd say, 'Everything's under control, Tifa.'

**Barret**  
Tifa\! When'd you become such a wimp\!

**Tifa**  
I'm sorry Barret.  
I'm kind of shocked myself. I'm so depressed.

**Nanaki**  
And Tifa...... the reason why we all thought it was Cloud was because......

**Tifa**  
......I know.  
That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again.

**Nanaki**  
Cheer up, Tifa......

**Vincent**  
......So glad you're all right Tifa.

**Barret**  
What? Does Cloud always gotta be around?.......  
We did fine without him in the beginning......  
Right? An' what happened to tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?

**Cid**  
I want you to know that I didn't dislike him.  
Gotta admit he was a strange dude.  
Just when you thought he was cool, he'd go and do some damn fool thing.  
And when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.  
Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd.  
Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.  
Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday, so cheer up, sis.

**Tifa**  
......I'll be able to see him someday.

**Cid**  
If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time.

**Nanaki**  
......Maybe  
Cloud is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up......  
Buried in the depths of the underground......

**Tifa**  
Deep within the earth...... are you talking about the Lifestream?

**Nanaki**  
The Lifestream sometimes gushes out to the surface from cracks in the ocean floor.  
I heard that such a place exists.  
Maybe, just maybe Cloud's......

**Pilot in Training (LV3)**  
Waaaaah\! Captain Cid\!

**Cid**  
Tifa, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship.  
Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.  
Oh, and Tifa......  
No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.  
Go to your room and get ready for our operation.  
I put a lot of things for the operation in your room, so put them in order.

Tifa goes to the Operations Room.

**Crew Member in Operation Room**  
Tifa, thank you for a job well done\!

Back on the bridge...

**Barret**  
Whenever I think of Cloud, everything gets all jumbled up.  
No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans.  
But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us......  
Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do......

**Nanaki**  
There appears to be a small island near the Lifestream......  
They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the south island.  
I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else......  
I'm sorry...... Tifa.

**Cait Sith**  
Everything appears calm right now at Shinra.  
So now's the time to look for Cloud.  
I'm worried about him, too.  
I wonder where Cloud is. Or could he already be......

**Vincent**  
Too much hope is the opposite of despair.  
An overpowering love may consume you in the end......

**Cid**  
OK\! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed.

**Pilot in Training (LV4)**  
Eagggghh\! Are we going?

**Tifa**  
\- We're going  
\- We're staying put

**Pilot in Training (LV4)**  
Eagggggh\! We're off\!

<span id="kalm"></span>At Kalm...

**Redhead**  
Huh? You're looking for your friend? You want to know where the Lifestream is?  
Let's see, I can't help you with your friend, but I've heard about the Lifestream.  
When I traveled to the southern islands, a doctor was very kind to me. I seem to recall him telling me something about the Lifestream......

**Old Man**  
Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?  
If that's the case then all we can do is put our hope in Shinra, Inc.

Inside the first house...

**Woman**  
They say the meteor is going to fall, but it's okay\! I'm sure Shinra will come through for us in the end and do something\!

**Girl Upstairs**  
I can't believe Meteor's really falling this way...... What's going to happen to us?

Inside the third house...

**Woman**  
Oh man, oh man\!  
A meteor's gonna fall on us, and now there's some big huge monster the likes of which I've never seen just wandering around out there\!  
What's going to happen to all of us\!\!?

Upstairs, a boy is running around while a little girl watches him.

**Girl**  
......My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke\!

**Boy**  
I'm gonna hurry up and get strong so I can crush the meteor to bits\! But I gotta train real hard to do it.  
Hyah, hayah, eagghh\!

Back outside...

**Man in Blue**  
The meteor's going to fall, isn't it? Unless Shinra does something about it, then we're all history\!

**Man**  
I want you to stop that talk about a Meteor falling on us\!

**Woman**  
Even if Meteor falls, If you're in Midgar, you ought to be safe.  
They say it's a "Mako Metropolis" so they should survive somehow......

Inside the fourth house...

**Woman**  
The meteor's coming, right? Where am I going to stash my money...? Wait, maybe I'd better take it with me and get out of here\!

<span id="kalmtraveler"></span>**Kalm Traveler**  
The world's changed a lot in the past few days......  
That huge monster Meteor was covering up the sky and acting like he owned it or something...  
A lot of my friends have died......  
I'm goin' on a journey to pray for their souls.  
A map that was sunk along with the ship. ...... "Guidebook"  
A rose that blooms once every 1000 years in the desert. ...... "Desert Rose"  
A harp that soothes those who hear it. ...... "Earth Harp"  
I wonder if there's anyone who'll bring it to me?

**Kid outside Bar**  
My dad still just sits at the bar drinking, even though he knows that Meteor's coming\!  
It's sad. Even though he's an adult, he just doesn't want to see the world as it really is. I dunno what to do.

Inside the bar...

**Person in Blue**  
And all of Midgar's gonna be destroyed by a falling meteor? Oh, don't make me laugh\!  
Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it\!

**Man**  
Listen, I've worked hard till now... and you say Meteor's gonna smash everything to bits?  
Well, I ain't standin' around listenin' to fool talk like this. Makes a person lose the will to work, that's what it does\!  
What're ya, dense? Something like that'll never happen? It's ridiculous\!

**Bartender**  
I heard Shinra's taking all its biggest artillery from Junon and its various other facilities and gathering it in Midgar to fight the meteor and Weapon.  
What's going to happen to the world...?

**Man in Blue** (checking the Mako pressure)  
What're you doing checking the pressure of the Mako energy at a time like this? It's probably already too late......  
It's times like this when you shouldn't go into a tail spin. You've got to continue to live orderly just like before.  
At least that's what I think...

<span id="chocobo"></span>At the Chocobo Farm...

**Choco Bill**  
Oh, what is that? What has this world come to? Stars falling and everything.  
With things the way they are now, how 'bout raising a Chocobo?  
No, I'm not trying to persuade you for money. It's just because of the state of things in the world.  
I thought that it would be a good and healthy thing for you to raise some Chocobos...  
Hmm... You just happen to be in luck\!  
It just so happens that we aren't taking care of any Chocobos for anyone else, so...  
I could take care of 6 Chocobos right now, for 10000 gil per Chocobo. How 'bout it?

**Tifa**  
\- Could you take care of the chocobos?  
\- I'd like to hear about something else  
\- Tell me how you raise them  
\- That's all

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Could you take care of the chocobos?</span>

**Choco Bill**  
To raise a Chocobo, you'll need a 'Chocobo Stable'.  
And they rent for 10000 gil. Currently, I can rent out up to 6 'Chocobo Stables'.  
If you rent a 'Chocobo Stable', we will keep up to 4 of the Chocobos you catch in the fenced area outside.  
At a later date, you can select the Chocobo that you would like to put in your 'Chocobo Stable'.  
'Chocobo Stables' cost 10000 gil...

**Tifa**  
\- Rent it

**Choco Bill**  
Thank you.  
My grandson takes care of the Chocobos. He's in the Chocobo Stable at the far right of the farm. Please tell him what you want.

Or, if you've already rented all of the available stables:

We don't have enough room to rent out more than 6 here...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'd like to hear about something else</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Someone once told me there is a 'Chocobo Sage'... somewhere.  
He seems to know how to raise some great Chocobos.  
If he really does exist, I'd like to meet him someday.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tell me how you raise them</span>

**Choco Bill**  
Chocobos aren't hard to take care of.  
The day to day care will all be done here.  
But, please buy the food for the Chocobo, and feed them yourselves.  
Chocobo's abilities will differ with what you feed it, so feel free to choose your own food.  
Also, if you're able to find a male and a female Chocobo that like each other, they'll produce an egg. But only if you feed them a 'Nut'.  
New Chocobos inherit the abilities of their parents.  
I've heard that sometimes new breeds of Chocobo are born with special abilities. I've never actually seen it before, though.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">That's all</span>

Nothing happens.

In the stable...

**Choco Billy**

\- Ride it outside?  
\- What are "Classes"?  
\- Nothing

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Feed?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
What the Chocobo eats are 'Greens' The most famous one is the 'Gizzard greens.'  
Chocobos will mature differently depending on which 'Greens' they eat. Certain 'Greens' will boost their stamina.  
You'll have to figure out what kinds have what effects for yourselves.  
Oh, and Chocobos are born with certain natural abilities. So no matter how much they mature, they can't get more abilities than what they're born with.  
Remember that if a Chocobo's abilities don't increase even though you feed it, that means its limit is reached.  
It's best to let those kinds of Chocobo go or mate them to get a new Chocobo.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Mating?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
A male and a female Chocobo together can produce an egg.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Chocobo by the fence?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
The Chocobo out there is part of the stock that you caught.  
We can only keep 4 Chocobos here at once. If you get a fifth one, the first one will have to be let go.  
If you don't want that to happen, come back and put it in your own stable.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Ride it outside?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Yeah, you can ride this one  
And even if you take it outside, this Chocobo won't run away when you get off of it.  
If you want to return to your 'Chocobo Stable' just ride it onto the farm.  
Then, you'll be able to feed it again.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What are "Classes"?</span>

**Choco Billy**  
Chocobos 'strengths are divided by 'Class'.

Otherwise...

**Choco Billy**  
Which one are you going to put in the 'Chocobo Stable'?  
Use the Directional button left or right and O.

Choco Billy will assess the chocobo on screen according to its stats, saying any of the following:

I really can't recommend this one.  
This one doesn't seem to be very good.  
Mmm, this one's not bad.  
This is a pretty average Chocobo.  
This Chocobo's so-so.  
Mmm, this seems like a good Chocobo.  
This is a great Chocobo.  
This... is a wonderful Chocobo\!

Once you select a chocobo...

**Chole**  
Welcome\! Hey, I've got something good to tell you.  
The white Chocobo likes it when you scratch behind its ears.  
But if you scratch it someplace that it doesn't like, it'll get mad, so be careful.

<span id="chocobo"></span>If you return to the Chocobo Farm after visiting the [Chocobo Sage](#chocobosage)...

**Chole**  
Hey, do you know what a Chocobo Sage is?  
What\!? You've actually met him\!?  
Wow\! What did he tell you?

Tifa tells her.

**Chole**  
Wow, that's amazing\! ...let me take some notes.

On any subsequent visit after seeing the Chocobo Sage...

**Chole**  
Hey, did you ever see the Chocobo Sage again? What did he tell you?

Tifa tells her.

**Chole**  
Wow, that's amazing\! ...let me take some notes.  
What...?

**Tifa**  
\- Let me jot this down  
\- Chole's Chocobo inspection  
\- Nothing

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let me jot this down</span>

**Chole**  
Other than regular Chocobo, there are "Mountain Chocobo" and "River-Chocobo".  
In order for the "Mountain Chocobo" and "River Chocobo" to be born,  
You feed the "Carob Nut" to a "Great Chocobo" or a "Good Chocobo" and have it produce an egg.  
But we don't sell any "Carob Nuts".  
A "Great Chocobo" and a "Good Chocobo" are found...  
On an island Southeast of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel. And in the area west of Corel.  
The "Carob Nut" can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling. Monsters carry them.  
Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there?  
One surprise If you get the "Mountain Chocobo" and the "River Chocobo" to produce an egg,  
You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and rivers. I bet that the right nut for that is the "Carob Nut."  
Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean.  
If you could cross the ocean, mountains, and rivers, there'd be no place you couldn't go.  
In order to get an Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-river Chocobo to mate with something else.  
If you mate the Mountain-and-river Chocobo with a "Wonderful Chocobo",  
You'll get an Ocean Chocobo. But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut.  
The "Nut" that produces Ocean Chocobos is the "Zeio Nut".  
This is the first I've heard of it. I wonder where you get them?  
Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage.  
"Goblins" have them. With this, you can produce an "Ocean Chocobo".  
According to my research, Mountain, river, and ocean Chocobos are hard to produce.  
But, if you take the right care of the Chocobo, and increase their Class ranking by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one.

</div>

<span class="highlight">Chole's Chocobo inspection</span>

**Chole** (if you have only one chocobo)  
Hey, there's only one Chocobo.

**Chole** (otherwise)  
For telling me that story, I'll tell you about each Chocobo's abilities.  
From what I see, the fastest sprinter is...  
I think it's Choco.  
And, the fastest one is...  
That's Choco  
Also, from what I can tell, the one with the most stamina is...

I almost passed out when I saw Weapon.  
It seems Weapon was beaten, but a Shinra soldier told me there are 4 more.

Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be destroyed...

**Older Man**  
What? Cloud is missing?

**Tifa**  
Maybe... he dropped some from the North Caves into the Lifestream...  
Sir, do you know where the Lifestream runs through?  
Cloud might have drifted from there.

**Older Man**  
What? The Northern... what? Sorry, but I don't think I follow.  
But... I think I remember hearing Priscilla saying 'Life... something' before.

Tifa goes to Priscilla's house.

**Priscilla**  
Who are you---?  
Lifestream?  
Yeah, I know\! It's Mr. Dolphin's playground.  
There's a Three-taloned island south of the continent. I heard the Lifestream runs below that island.  
But why are you asking about the Lifestream?

**Tifa**  
Cloud fell into the Lifestream at the North Cave, and has been missing ever since.

**Priscilla**  
Huh, Cloud\!?  
Hurry up and help him\!\! He's very important to me.

In Upper Junon...

**Soldier**  
It's kinda lonely at the airport without the Highwind, isn't it?  
I miss that bikini girl on the side of the plane.

**Soldiers at the Airport**  
I sure was frightened when Weapon attacked. It gives me the chills knowing there's still two of them left.  
Oh yeah? Well, I'm ready to fight the worst enemy mankind's ever had like a real warrior. It's not everyday you get to fight in an inter-planetary war.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Come on in\!  
Welcome\!\!  
I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon really existed.

**Weapon Shopkeeper**  
This machine hasn't been working right ever since Weapon got to it\!

In the bar downstairs...

**Man**  
Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here soused as usual.

**Barkeeper**  
I'd like to close down this shop, but we got the regulars to think about... I don't know what to do......

**Item Shopkeeper**  
They're not going to get me down\! Not me\!\!  
Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me\!

Inside the barracks...

**Soldier Guarding the Respectable Inn**  
Hmmm? You have no right to enter\!

**Commander** (drilling a soldier)  
Hey\!\! Stay out of the way\!

**Soldier**  
I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore.

**Commander**  
Hey\! Stop yappin'\!

**Soldier**  
I've been had\!\! I want to get in a real battle, too\!

**Soldier Studying**  
I lost most of my rivals in the attack on Weapon.  
Oh, of course, I was here, studying.  
And the coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach.  
After that, I'll get on the newspapers as a plain clothed First Class officer in SOLDIER...  
A triumphant return to my homeland\!\! Tons of fan letters... My future's peachy\!

Shinra Member's Bar...

**Barkeeper**  
I'm sorry. I've decided to close this place down.  
All my regular customers were killed by Weapon.  
Everyone was pretty weird, but I got a lot of memories of them.

2nd floor materia shop...

**Girl**  
Please\! Come in...

**Girls**  
Welcome\!

**Honey Bee Girl**  
Look, why not forget about Meteor and Weapon for now and do a little impulse shopping\!?

**Black-haired Girl**  
Buy a lot, cutie\!

**Redhead**  
I won't charge you for a smile...

**Girl**  
Please go to the counter.

**Woman**  
Why don't you surround yourself with young girls and have some fun... maybe for the last time.

**Shopkeeper**  
I hired more girls after hearing that the world's coming to an end, but I wonder if I made a mistake.  
I keep getting more and more in debt. I've got to get out from under it somehow. Maybe I'll have Weapon help me.

**Girls**  
Thank you very much\!

3rd floor accessory shop. The shopkeeper is dressed in a black cloak.

**Shopkeeper**  
I used to be in SOLDIER. Recently, I've felt like dressing up like this...  
I don't know why, it's out of season, but...

In another barracks...

**Soldier** (trying to cross his legs casually)  
I'm learning to be a delinquent soldier\!\!  
I just can't seem to get the hang of it\! It just isn't going right\!\!

**Delinquent Soldier**  
All the real soldiers were killed fighting Weapon.  
It may seem ironic that losers like me are still alive. But that's the reality of it.

Upstairs...

**Shinra Manager**  
I only came to help with the transporting of Junon's Huge Cannon, Sister Ray, but...  
Now the company tells me not to bother coming back...  
What's being a Shinra employee all about...?  
Yeeeeee......  
If Weapon killed all the upper management... then I'll be President...\!\!

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Weapon was really something. Nothing can compare with his strength, but with a selection like this, our weapons'll win.

The docks are empty.

**Sailor**  
Everyday there's no ship coming in, I always come here to watch the sun go down.  
The sun disappears almost like it's swallowed up in the big horizon.  
And somewhere out there is a big unknown continent with another port city.  
Twilight always gets me misty...  
I'm so glad I became a seaman.  
Well... I wouldn't have time for one now anyway because of that Weapon thing...  
I haven't had a girl friend in 18 years. And I'm a romantic\! ......phew.

<span id="costa"></span>At Costa del Sol...

At the harbor...

**Man Near Sea Plane**  
Well, I'm not worried. When it all comes down, I'm heading for the skies.  
The only problem is...... will there be anywhere left to land?

**Woman Lounging on Sea Plane**  
Not gonna be able to nap like this for much longer.  
When you put it that way, I feel kind of sad.

**Sailor**  
There's no ship to Junon. Recently, there's been a hoard on materials. Everything's topsy-turvy.

**Sailor Running Around**  
Everyone's in a rush to get one last vacation in before the Meteor strikes, That's why it's so busy here.

Back to the town...

**Woman at the Information Kiosk**  
I don't feel like sightseeing around town. What I really want to do is... Looks like Gold Saucer is temporarily closed.

In the bar...

**Waitress**  
I wan' learn how speak beddah. But don' wan' have stars fall down. You think... same?

**White Surfer**  
I don't care if it's the Meteor or not, I'm not giving up yet\!  
I still haven't surfed the best waves of Costa del Sol\!  
I hope the Meteor doesn't strike before I do.

**Black Surfer**  
It's weird seeing the reflection of the Meteor on the sea in the evening\!  
It gives you the creeps.

**Black Man**  
...huff... wheeze...  
Heat and cold are just memories of the Planet......

**Man**  
I don't understand what my boss is thinking\!  
I'm gonna yell at him\! I'm gonna scream my head off till it gets ugly\!  
Isn't that what life's all about? What do you think?

**Mukki**  
I'm just sitting here havin' a quiet drink.

**Woman Behind Counter**  
When you're in here, forget all those awful things going on outside, and... just enjoy yourself.

Back outside...

**Women**  
They're burning. Someday they'll burn out.  
The stars are just like our youth.  
Ho\! Ho\! Ho\!...... It's the end of the world.

**Little Boy**  
Oh wow\!\! Man, that's huge\!\!

**Little Girl**  
The stars\!\! They're in flames\!\!

At Johnny's house...

**Johnny**  
I proposed to her in the middle of all that Meteor stuff\!  
I don't care even if the world were to end right now\!  
I can't think of anything else\!

**Butch**  
Good or bad everything's gotta go\! It's the end of the world sale\!\!

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Wanna buy a souvenir to remember participating in the Meteor tour?

**Innkeeper** (lying in bed)  
I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to spend the rest of my life sleeping.  
Will you be staying together?

**Tifa**  
\- Yes  
\- No thanks

At the beach...

**Man**  
Sitting around waiting for Meteor to come...... Why's it gotta fall on us?

**Woman**  
It's getting closer and closer. Someone will do something, don't you think?

**Woman 2**  
The sea breeze, sun and Meteor. Isn't nature strange?

**Woman 3**  
I don't care even if it is the end of the world, I just want to sit here and drink cocktails\!  
Ooooh...... I think I drank too much.

**Man Swimming**  
Eaaggh\!\! Leave me alone\!  
I'm trying to learn how to swim before the end of the world.

<span id="corel"></span>At North Corel...

**Man**  
Staring up at Meteor won't put food in my stomach.  
But if I look down, sometimes I find somethin' to eat.

Inside a tent...

**Old Man**  
The next train's coming in soon.

**Black Woman**  
As long as we're here, Grandpa's not going to be able to forget about trains.  
Maybe we'll start anew, moving to Southern Isle of Mideel.

**Big Man**  
Look down... nuthin' but junk. Look up... Meteor.  
Am I gonna be stuck between these two for the rest of my life?

**Man in Hardhat**  
Hey, what's gonna happen to the world...?  
I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold Saucer is closing...

At the ropeway...

**Station Man**  
The Gold Saucer is currently closed. The Ropeway's up and runnin', but there's no point in goin' there.

---

<span id="gold"></span>At Gold Saucer...

**Dio**  
I'm sorry, I'm gonna close this for a while.  
I'm just debating if I should be in business at a time like this.

---

<span id="gongaga"></span>At Gongaga...

**Old Man**  
You lost? When that happens the only ones you can count on are your friends.  
The first thing you gotta do is find your best friend.

**Redhead**  
Life Stream? Never heard of it.  
The Planet's structure? ...Who cares about that?  
Why don't you go ask Bugenhagen of Cosmo Canyon hard questions like that?

---

<span id="cosmo"></span>At Cosmo Canyon...

**Gatekeeper**  
Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star...  
The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside.  
I'd rather not see it either...

**Man**  
Mmm...... I can't be standing here talking about the 'Study of Planet Life'.  
I think I'll be heading back to my homeland now...

**General Storekeeper**  
Hi. Of course, our store's open.  
No need to fear. I have the 'Study of Planet Life' right here.  
No, maybe I AM a bit afraid. But, whenever I'm reading 'Study of Planet Life,' I can forget all my fears.

**Barkeeper**  
How about our original cocktail, 'Lifestream'?  
You should forget your troubles with a drink. We humans sure are weak creatures...  
That reminds me. I heard that someone here in Cosmo Canyon is selling some Healing Materia.

**Elder Bugah**  
Live with the planet, die with the planet.  
Maybe this is the way it should be. Who knows? I'm full of booze...  
It's when I think about the children. I wonder if we could just save our own children.

**Kid in Nanaki's Room**  
It's not that I'm afraid of that big star.  
It's just that, uh, I have a stomach ache... That's why I'm not moving. That's the truth\!

**Innkeeper**  
Welcome to 'Shindra Inn'. It's times like this a nice, soft bed will do you good.

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
Welcome. You still want more weapons? You sure are weird...  
Uh, I mean, it's weird. if there weren't people like you, I'll be out of business. Heh, heh, heh... sweat...\!

**Elder Hargo**  
Mm... oh, this? This is the book of Stars. I'm just finishing it.  
Nothing is meaningless. If I do this then, someday, someone will run across it.  
The Ancients did the same. That is how we know about them, right? Maybe my book also......

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Oh man... Everything is over, once the meteor hits...  
I've been selling Materia for 10 years now, ever since I was 16. What have I been doing with my life...?  
Welcome\! Oh, it's nothing. Now, please make yourselves comfortable\!

In living quarters next door...

**Woman**  
Hmm... I wonder what's going to happen now...

**Kid**  
Don't worry, mom\! All of us just need to go through that door\!  
Mr. Bugenhagen sealed it so we wouldn't have to worry about it\!  
But what's a seal...?

Up at the observatory...

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo.  
...no time to be humming now. The planet is nearing imminent death.  
Where is Cloud? Wasn't he with you?

**Tifa**  
That's why we're here... Cloud... Cloud has...

She explains.

**Bugenhagen**  
I see... Cloud has......  
It's true that there are several places on the planet where Lifestream is gathered.  
But most of those places are below the surface where humans cannot reach them.  
There's only one place. An island floating in the Southern Sea...  
What did you say? I haven't left here in years... No good. I can't remember.  
In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where Lifestream is.  
But even if you find Cloud there...  
Life's dream is a mass of spiritual energy,  
and one person alone probably couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current...

<span id="nibelheim"></span>At Nibelheim...

**Woman in Shop**  
How can you shop at a time like this?  
What? 'Me, in business'?  
Don't worry, it's all right. I get paid by the company.  
My real job is to protect the secret of Nibelheim.  
What? Secret?  
We don't have a clue. But it's all right.  
It's all over anyway\!  
The end, the end, the end\!\! Yeah, even as we speak, Meteor...\! The End...\!

In Cloud's house...

**Woman**  
What's going to happen to this planet\!? What the hell's Shinra doing\!?

In Tifa's room, at the piano...

**Tifa**  
Cloud... Cloud was playing.  
I wonder what... this is...

<div class="highlight">

Received "Elemental" Materia\!

<span id="rocket"></span>At Rocket Town...

In the Inn...

**Man Looking at Paintings**  
Mmmm... I'm starting to see it now...

**Innkeeper** (if you go behind the desk)  
Authorized personnel only.

**Barkeeper**  
You don't feel comfortable here? Then, every time you look in the sky you see Meteor.

**Man**  
Meteor's coming toward us\!? And I can't even go to the bathroom...\!?

Back outside...

**Redhead**  
If things go on like this, then Meteor's just going to smash right into us and kill us all, right? ......I guess that's life?

**Mechanic**  
Look up at the sky. The bigger Meteor gets, the less time we have to live.

**Old Man**  
Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from Corel and Fort Condor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.  
I can't stand the thought of them using my rocket for something like this.  
Anyways.  
How 'bout it? Want to look at the rocket with me?

**Tifa**  
\- Look up  
\- No

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Look up</span>

**Old Man**  
It seems like there's a lot happenin' in the outside world, but as long as I got this rocket... I'm satisfied.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Old Man**  
Oh, how boring...

</div>

At Cid's house...

**Shera**  
...What's going to happen?

<span id="wutai"></span>At Wutai...

**Woman Walking Near River**  
Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether that planet falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.

At the old man's house...

**Old Man**  
Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon in the afternoon. Everyone's celebrating.

**Boy**  
No, Gramps\! That's a big red planet in the sky\! Everyone's scared of it\!\!

At the Weapons Shop...

**Man**  
This is a weapons store of the hard cores, by the hard cores, and for the hard cores\! Come on and take a look, why doncha\!?

**Shopkeeper**  
Hey yo\! Welcome\!  
You aren't tired of my babbling?  
Great\! Then come on in and start buying\!

At Turtle's Paradise...

**Barkeeper**  
First the ground started shaking, then that large star......  
Yy, you think... It's all over?

**Man**  
Hey. Things look pretty sad around here.  
With things the way they are in the world I guess there's nothing I can do about it.  
Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all might as well sit back and have a beer...

**Little Kid**  
When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust\! Can't we do something?

At the Item Shop...

**Shopkeeper**  
You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?  
You're an odd one...

**Woman**  
And now it's too late to be worrying about materia at this stage of the game...  
If you see anything you need, buy it.

**Man on the Path to Godo's House**  
The end is right in front of us...  
But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life day in and day out...

**Man Outside Godo's House**  
Have you ever heard the story of the scales of the Water God?  
They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. And are impervious to the strongest flames.  
But of course I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Planet's gonna make when it crashes into us...

In the shrine...

**People Praying**  
num, num...... I hope the planet doesn't fall anywhere around here......  
He's in the pagoda next to Lord Godo. Lord Godo says we're stuck...  
Help me. Help me. Help me......

<span id="bone"></span>At Bone Village...

**Excavator**  
Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.  
You need something?

**Tifa**  
\- Are you going to run away??  
\- What are you doing?

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Are you going to run away??</span>

**Excavator**  
We've already learned about everything that has happened from the beginning of this Planet through fossils.  
Now, we want to see on through to the end of the Planet... It's such a mixed feeling...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What are you doing?</span>

**Excavator**  
We're excavating. It's like the land's telling a history of the planet.

<span id="ancients"></span>At the City of the Ancients...

When Tifa touches one of the glowing orbs...

**Tifa**  
Eyaaaa\!  
...Consciousness of the Ancients?  
...I'm sorry. ...I can't... understand.  
Eaayy\!? Again?  
It speaks directly to my mind... Is this the Consciousness of the Ancients?  
...I'm sorry. ...I can't... understand.

When Cid touches one of the glowing orbs...

**Cid**  
Whoa...\!  
...Consciousness of the Ancients?

\* Note: The dialogue box for the above line is labeled in game with Tifa's name.

Hey Ancients, I don't even have a clue, what you're trying to say to me.  
Whoa, shit\! Not again\!  
Who is it? Who's trying to peek into my mind?  
Is it the Consciousness of the Ancients?  
Hey Ancients, I don't even have a clue, what you're trying to say to me.

<span id="icicle"></span>At Icicle Inn...

Inside the small house...

**Woman**  
I don't think I could live in this town. It gets so cold here\!  
I have to move again... I don't know where to start.

**Man**  
The reason for the drop in temperature must be because of that dome of light at the Northern limits...  
You all should get away from here and go to a place like Mideel Island in the south.

**Boy**  
I wanted to get a lot better at snowboarding...

Inside the large house...

**Old Woman**  
Cough... cough... I've been living in this town for 60 years. And STILL I caught a cold...  
I heard there's a doctor on a Southern island somewhere. I sure wish he'd come here... cough... cough...

**Woman**  
Grandma's been sick for a while and doesn't have much energy lately...

**Man in Yard**  
It's the first time that the temperature has dipped this low, this fast...  
There's also that mysterious light at the Northern limits too. Does it mean that we've reached the end of the world?

At Icicle Inn...

**Man**  
With all the strange things happening in the world, I kinda understand why people want to leave...

**Man 2**  
Maybe we'd better leave town soon too.  
Let's go to that island in the South\! What was it called...... hmm?  
Yeah, yeah, I heard that there's a town called Mideel on a southern island.

**Person in Bathroom**  
I'm still in here\! All right\!?

Back outside...

**Little Girls**  
I heard that there's a barrier on top of the mountain.  
What's a barrier? You mean that light on the top of the mountain?

**Man in Thicket**  
There's a barrier at the North end of the crater\! You shouldn't go any further.

<span id="chocobosage"></span>The Chocobo Sage's house becomes accessible after gaining the Highwind, but can be visited while Tifa, Cid, or Cloud is the party leader.

**Chocobo Sage**  
Ho ho. It's unusual for people to come to such an out of the way place...  
I can't remember how many years it's been since the last person came.

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
Who are you?

**Chocobo Sage**  
Me? I'm......  
I don't know.

> **Cloud**  
> You don't know who you are?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Wha? You don't know who you are?
>
> **Cid**  
> Huh? You're sayin' you don't even know who you are?

**Chocobo Sage**  
Been a while since I gave it any thought...  
Wonder what they used to call me?  
Oh yeah\!\! They used to call me the 'Chocobo Sage'. That's right\!\!  
Right, that was it, The Chocobo Sage\!\!

> **Cloud**  
> (no one would forget that)
>
> **Tifa**  
> (Who would forget that?)
>
> **Cid**  
> (the hell's up with this guy?)

**Chocobo Sage**  
Now what can I do for you?

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
\- What about that Chocobo?

**Chocobo Sage**  
That chocobo? Well that one is...  
Let's see now, I don't quite remember...

On a second visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Now what can I do for you?

**Cloud, Tifa, or Cid**  
\- You remember something?

**Chocobo Sage**  
I remember now\! That's the one they call...  
It's a Mountain Chocobo. And just like the name says, he can cross any mountain.  
There was another one that could cross rivers, too. They call him 'River Chocobo'.

> **Cloud**  
> Where can we catch one?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Where can we find one?
>
> **Cid**  
> Where can I get one of those Whatdyacallem chocobos?

**Chocobo Sage**  
There aren't any around now.

> **Cloud**  
> ...... That's one right there isn't it?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What about that one right there?
>
> **Cid**  
> What're you flappin' about? There's one right there\!

**Chocobo Sage**  
Wha? I wonder what he's doing there?  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a third visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh, oh yeah\! That chocobo was...  
......was bred from a 'Great Chocobo' and a 'Good Chocobo'.  
When they're given "Carob Nuts" while breeding, there's a chance you'll get one of these Chocobos.

> **Cloud**  
> So where's this chocobo?  
> So where can I get some of these 'Carob Nuts'?
>
> **Tifa**  
> So where can I find those Chocobos?  
> ...and what about those 'Carob Nuts'...
>
> **Cid**  
> So where is the chocobo?  
> And what about those nut things?

**Chocobo Sage**  
Huh? Where? Where was that?  
And what was that nut?  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a fourth visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh, OK. I remember\! That chocobo...  
...It's on an island southeast of here, In a place called Corel surrounded by greenery.  
You should be able to catch one just west of Corel. And some 'Carob Nuts', too......  
There used to be some monsters just south of here that had them. Or you might...  
............ Funny...... What was I saying just now?  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a fifth visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh right\!  
It was about the Mountain Chocobo and the River Chocobo I told you about.  
When you mate these two together...  
...you get one that can cross rivers AND mountains.  
And... And also... uh, what was I saying?  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a sixth visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh, yeah\! And also...  
There's one that can cross oceans, too\!

> **Cloud**  
> You probably don't remember but...  
> How can I get one of those Chocobos?
>
> **Tifa**  
> You probably are going to say you forgot, but...  
> How can I get one of those chocobos?
>
> **Cid**  
> Great\! I know you probably already forgot but,  
> Where can I get one of those chocobos?

**Chocobo Sage**  
Hey, don't tease me like that\! To get an Ocean-crossing Chocobo, you just...  
Let's see now... ...Nope. Don't remember a thing.  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a seventh visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh, I remember\! The Ocean-crossing Chocobo is...  
The Mountain-and-River-crossing Chocobo is...... is... Oh, what was I saying?  
Let's see now... ...Nope. Don't remember a thing.

On an eighth visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Right, right\! I remember\! You take the Mountain-and-River-crossing Chocobo...  
Mate it with a 'Wonderful Chocobo' you can catch right around here... And you'll get...  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a ninth visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh, right\! You'll need a...  
'Zeio Nut'. Now let me see, as I remember, the Zeio nut...  
Where was it you could find those things?  
Can't remember for the life of me...

On a tenth visit...

**Chocobo Sage**  
Oh yeah\! Zeio nuts were...  
The favorite of goblins. There's a small island east of here where the goblins have a bunch of them.

And finally...

**Chocobo Sage**  
I think...  
...that's all I'm gonna remember.  
Oh\!  
That's it...

<span id="search"></span>Tifa leads the way into Mideel.

**Old Man at Entrance**  
Ahoy\! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet little Hot Springs town.  
Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our lives.  
I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here it's still nice and quiet.

In the Item Shop, a woman is running around frantically, followed by a baby white chocobo.

**Shopper**  
But anyhow, that overgrown moon is going to fall down on us isn't it?  
This's no joke\! We've got to start stocking up on supplies before they're all gone\!  
Outta the way\! Hey, move it, move it\!

If Tifa is carrying Mimett Greens, she can talk to the chocobo.

**Tifa**  
What is it? You're being awful friendly all of a sudden.  
Oh, so that's it. You want the Samolen Greens... don't you?  
\- Give it some Samolen Greens  
\- Don't give it any

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give it some Samolen Greens</span>

**Tifa**  
Well, okay. Here, go ahead and eat.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks like it enjoyed eating the Greens.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the party hasn't obtained the chocobo's materia...</span>

**Tifa**  
hee hee... how cute\! I just want to tickle him.  
\- Tickle his feet  
\- Tickle his stomach  
\- Tickle his neck  
\- Tickle his belly button  
\- Tickle behind his ears  
\- Tickle under his arms

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tickle his feet</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks like it loves that.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tickle his stomach</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks a little ticklish.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tickle his neck</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks a little angry.

</div>

**Tifa**  
Oh, you scared me...\! I thought you were dead\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tickle his belly button</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks a little shy.

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tickle behind his ears</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received Materia from the Chocobo\!

</div>

</div>

<span class="highlight">Tickle under his arms</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks bored.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the party already obtained the chocobo's materia...</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Dined and dashed.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't give it any</span>

**Tifa**  
Sorry, little guy. I can't give you any.

</div>

**Shopkeeper**  
Welcome\! We always welcome cash\! Now, about where you want to go...  
I'm afraid other customers have already booked it up. There's nothing left.  
......just kidding\! Just a little joke. Now what can I do for you?  
Thank you\! Come again\!

**Girl in Blue Outside**  
Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain\!\!  
We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else.  
But it's first come first served, so get yours now\!  
Step right up\! You there, don't just stand around outside.  
Go on in\! Come on\! Don't be shy, step right up\!  
I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town like this. What's up with him......? ...sigh......

On the upper platform at the far left...

**Man**  
Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your turn. Even the world's gotta end sometime.  
Everybody leaves at one time or another. And everyone gets left also. That's just fate...  
It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So that's why I'm prayin' like this for all of you.

Or, after obtaining materia from the white chocobo:

That kid got a green stone from that Chocobo\! I'm so jealous.

As she walks past him, there is a clinking noise.

**Tifa**  
Huh......? What could that be?  
There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key... It's hard to get out.  
Well, I'll just let it go for now......

In the Weapons Shop...

**Shopper**  
You again\! You aren't here hoarding up goods too are you?  
Don't reach in front of me\! Everything in this store is mine\!  
I've got money to burn\! I've been saving it like mad just for a time like this\!  
C'mon, outta the way\! Move, will you? Move\!

**Shopkeeper**  
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage\! What can I get you today?  
Thank you very much\! Please come again.

In the back of the store is a door. Tifa knocks on it.

**Tifa**  
No good... I wonder if it's locked?

She returns to the key.

**Tifa**  
I wonder if there isn't some way to get this outta here...?  
If I just move this...... And push that...... Okay\! I got it out\!

Or, if she didn't notice the key earlier:

There's something stuck deep inside that looks like an old key...

<div class="highlight">

Received a "Beat-up Useless Old Key"\!

</div>

Inside the nearby house...

**Woman**  
You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall outta the sky? Is that for real?  
I still don't believe it\! How could this be happen?

**Old Man**  
Ancient Weapon? End of the world? I don't know nothing about that\! I'm gonna live to be a hundred\!  
There's tons of stuff I still gotta do\! This's just the beginning.  
And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me\! They're a waste\!\!

**Girl**  
Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I just work here in the accessory store part-time.  
Everything here can compare with the best goods anywhere. So, how about one?  
Thank you. Stop by again.

Back to the Weapons Shop, Tifa again inspects the door...

**Tifa**  
Oh yeah, shall I try that old beat up key?  
\- Use the beat up old key\!  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Use the beat up old key\!</span>

Okay, this is it.  
hmm. Huh...? This is pretty tight...  
Eyaaah...\!?  
Oh no\! ......it broke. Now I can't get it out...

**Shopkeeper**  
Is something wrong......?

**Tifa**  
Ulp\!?  
Huh? Uh, no......  
What am I gonna do......?  
\- Lie your butt off\!  
\- Tell them the truth\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Lie your butt off\!</span>

Nothing\! I was just thinking how nice that door was, that's all.

**Shopkeeper**  
Oh... why, thank you very much.

**Tifa**  
Whew... that was close. But that was kind of bad...

Tifa looks at the door.

...... The key's broken off inside, and I can't get to it...  
...... I don't know anything about it.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tell them the truth\!</span>

I'm... sorry\! I forced the key and it broke\!

**Shopkeeper**  
Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?

Tifa nods.

**Shopkeeper**  
Hah, hah, hah\! That's a good one\!

**Tifa**  
???

**Shopkeeper**  
Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.

**Tifa**  
What\!? It's not a real door?

**Shopkeeper**  
That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.  
Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.

**Tifa**  
Really? Thank you.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Tifa and the others received "Cursed Ring"\!

</div>

**Shopkeeper**  
If possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another world  
I got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

I'd better not. It doesn't look like it even fits.

</div>

**Woman**  
Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're things on the outside?  
Between the earthquakes and Meteor...... It just might be the end of the world like everyone's been sayin'...  
Oh, how depressing\! What a miserable world this is......

In the Materia shop...

**Shopper**  
Ohh...... there's not much time left\!\! You never know when that moon is gonna come crashing down\!\!  
When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things\!  
If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever\!  
Gotta buy\!\! Gotta buy, buy, buy\!\! I'm gonna shop till I drop\!\!

**Shopkeeper**  
Ah, welcome to you\! What I get you to-day?  
Thank very much\! You come 'gain.

<span id="cloud"></span>Outside, Tifa comes across a lone dog.

**Tifa**  
What's the matter? Are you all alone?

She kneels down in front of it as it whines.

You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love......? Silly thing...

**Bald Man**  
......guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore... Poor pokey-headed young thing...

**Old Man**  
It was really sad...... but weird. He was holding this really long sword.  
I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes......

**Tifa**  
Wha\!?

She jumps up.

Wh...... wait a minute\!\! What did you just say\!?

She runs over to the two men.

Excuse me\! That young person you were just talking about......

**Bald Man**  
Yeah... a villager found him a little ways down the coast... It was about a week ago I think.

**Old Man**  
Yeah, poor kid...... He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away...

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!\! It must be\!\! It's Cloud\!\!

> **Barret**  
> You sure\!?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Over here\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> BINGO\!\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Jackpot\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> You've found him.
>
> **Cid**  
> Heh, good job, Tifa.

**Tifa**  
So where is he? Is he safe\!? Where is he now......?

**Bald Man**  
Yeah... up ahead here... At the, uh, clinic......

**Tifa**  
He's alive...\!  
Cloud...... Cloud's alive\!\!

She runs off towards the clinic.

Cloud......\!\!

> **Barret**  
> Uh......\!? Yo, Tifa\!\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Halt\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Oh, HEY\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Wait up\!

Tifa runs into the clinic.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!?

**Doctor**  
Here now. The way you're running around here, you'd think Meteor fell or something.

**Tifa**  
I'm sorry, but I heard that a friend of mine was being taken care of here......

**Doctor**  
A friend...?  
Oh yeah......\! That young fellow\!?  
Don't worry. Your friend is next door. But I'm afraid his condition is...

**Tifa**  
Here?  
Over here.

She runs into the next room, where Cloud is sitting in a wheelchair with a nurse near him.

Cloud...\!?

The nurse steps aside and lowers her head. The doctor comes to the doorway as the others run into the clinic.

**Tifa**  
Oh... Cloud\!\! I'm so glad you're safe\!?  
......\!?  
Cloud......?

**Cloud**  
Uh...... aaa......?

**Tifa**  
Wh...... what's wrong...... Cloud......?

**Cloud**  
A...... Gurk......?

**Tifa**  
Cloud\! What happened to you......\!?

**Doctor**  
Mako poisoning...... Quite an advanced case......  
It appears this young man's been exposed to a high level of Mako energy for a protracted period of time.  
He probably has no idea who or where he is now......  
Poor fellow, his voice doesn't even work. He is literally miles away from us.  
Some place far away where no one's ever been... All alone......

**Tifa**  
Doctor......\!\!

> **Barret**  
> That's bad......
>
> **Nanaki**  
> How horrible......
>
> **Yuffie**  
> You lyin' or what\!?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> That's terrible......
>
> **Vincent**  
> .........
>
> **Cid**  
> Damn...... that's evil.

Tifa drops to her knees before Cloud.

**Tifa**  
Cloud......

**Doctor**  
Ahem\! Let us excuse ourselves.  
Listen, would you all mind...... waiting outside?

**Barret**  
......

Everyone files outside, leaving Tifa alone with Cloud.

**Tifa**  
Why......? What do you want me to do?  
Please, Cloud...... Talk to me......  
Tell me you see me, that you can hear me...... Tell me, please......  
I came this far believing in the memories we have together...  
This isn't happening......\! This is too cruel......  
Oh, Cloud......\! I............

Meanwhile, outside...

> **Barret**  
> So what about him? You know...... Cloud?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Tell me doctor, is Cloud all right? I mean will he heal?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Hey doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hey doctor, is Cloud all right? Is he gonna get better? Come on, tell us the truth.
>
> **Cid**  
> Listen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth.  
> What about Cloud? Is he all right?

**Doctor**  
I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad...  
An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was put into his brain all at once......  
No normal human could have survived it...... It's a miracle he did\!

> **Barret**  
> No wonder...... After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here......
>
> **Nanaki**  
> No wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and was washed up here......
>
> **Yuffie**  
> No lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> No wonder. After falling into the Lifestream......
>
> **Cid**  
> No wonder...... After all he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.

**Doctor**  
But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.  
Listen, if you give up hope... What will happen to him?

> **Nanaki**  
> Hmm, I know he'll recover\! Cloud was a strong member of SOLDIER.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Yeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Yeah\! I know Cloud'll get better\!  
> With friends like us worrying about him He can't go wrong.
>
> **Cid**  
> ......... Hope............  
> I guess that's all that's left for us now......

**Barret**  
......hope......  
Hey, but honestly, man...... Do I really want him to come back?  
What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow......

**Doctor**  
Is something wrong?

**Barret**  
No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, doc.

Tifa steps outside.

**Tifa**  
.........

> **Barret**  
> You okay?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Are you all right, Tifa?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> You okay, Tifa?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> You all right?
>
> **Cid**  
> You okay?

**Tifa**  
Yes...... I'm sorry I had you all worried.  
And I have something I want to tell you all......

She turns back inside and the others follow.

**Tifa**  
I don't care about anything else, only Cloud......  
I...... want to be by his side......

> **Barret**  
> Yeah, that's probably best......  
> For Cloud...... an' for you......
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Yes, that's best\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> You gotta do it then. You gotta live true to yourself.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> If Tifa was my nurse, I'd switch places with Cloud any day\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> Do what you wish.
>
> **Cid**  
> Yeah. Right. Hang in there, Tifa.

**Tifa**  
I'm sorry, everyone... At a time like this......

> **Barret**  
> Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> That's all right. We'll be by again.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> No big, no big. I'll pop in again later.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> What're you talkin' about? Not even. We'll stop in again.
>
> **Vincent**  
> Don't worry. We'll return and check on him later.
>
> **Cid**  
> Don't worry. I'll stop by again sometime.

> **Barret**  
> You take care now, Tifa. And take care of Cloud.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Do your best, Tifa. Take care of Cloud.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Look after Cloud. Take care, Tifa.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hope Cloud gets better soon.
>
> **Vincent**  
> Take care of him.
>
> **Cid**  
> You hang in there, Tifa. Take care of Cloud.

**Tifa**  
Right......

**Barret**  
Oh, and uh, Tifa... I don't like askin' this but......  
Is he really your childhood friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?

**Tifa**  
Huh\!? Well... that is......  
No, I'm sure of it\!

**Barret**  
Yeah......? Okay then...... Sorry for askin' that.

> **Barret**  
> We gotta get back to the Highwind.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> We should be getting back to the Highwind.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Hey, shouldn't we be gettin' back to the Highwind?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Well, I guess we'd better go back to the Highwind.
>
> **Vincent**  
> Very well then, we should be getting back to the Highwind.
>
> **Cid**  
> Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind.

---

<span id="materia"></span>The others leave Tifa with Cloud and return to the Highwind.

**Barret**  
What're we gonna do now\! What can WE do?  
Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?  
An' don' go tellin' us to wait for Cloud to get better.

**Cait Sith**  
Oh, I've got some news.

**Barret**  
Yeah, what\!? That you a spy?

**Cait Sith**  
Yeah...... I've already told you I was.  
Both gya ha ha and Kya ha ha, are up to something.  
Wanna eavesdrop?

---

In the Conference Room at Shinra HQ...

**Rufus**  
Now then...... We're faced with two issues.  
1 Destroy Meteor. 2 Remove the barrier around North Cave and defeat Sephiroth.  
Any ideas?

**Heidegger**  
Gya haah hah hah\! We already solved the first problem\!  
Meteor will soon be smashed to bits\!  
The plan has already been put in motion. Namely, to collect Huge Materia from each region.

**Rufus**  
Well......

**Scarlet**  
Huge Materia is a high density special type of materia made through a special compression process in Mako reactors.  
The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal materia.  
Ha, ha, ha\! How about that\!?  
We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into Meteor.  
That will cause a huge explosion\!\! Reducing Meteor literally to bits.

**Rufus**  
You're going to ram Meteor?  
Do you think we have the technology to do it?

**Scarlet**  
Don't worry about that\!  
More importantly, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area.

**Heidegger**  
We've already collected materia from Nibelheim.  
All that's left is "Corel" and "Fort Condor".  
I've already dispatched troops to Corel.  
Ghaa haah hah hah\!

---

<span id="leader"></span>Back on the Highwind...

**Barret**  
Corel\!  
What else can they do to Corel\!?

**Nanaki**  
And the Huge Materia......  
You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.  
When, our small materia nears the larger one, something should happen.  
I'm certain of it.  
That's why we're using the power of materia in our fight......

**Barret**  
Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia\!  
Besides, when Cloud gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked.

**Cait Sith**  
So, what are you saying, Barret?  
Even though you're always knocking him, you really want Cloud to return.

**Barret**  
I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. You just... shut your face\!  
Every group's gotta have a leader.  
An' that's me\!  
Or at least I wanna be... But I ain't cut out to be no leader.  
I never knew that till lately.  
An' that's what is......

**Cid**  
......ZZZZ...... hmph?

He wakes and gets to his feet.

Wha? What's goin' on?

**Barret**  
You been chosen to be the new leader.

**Cid**  
Pain in the ass. Forget it.

**Barret**  
But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.  
We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You\!  
That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can.

**Cid**  
Hm...... this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?  
Oh man, that went straight to my heart.  
I'm a man, too\!  
Okay, I'll do it\! Everyone, follow me\!

**Barret**  
Awright, now here's the first job.  
The Operation Room's waiting for you\!

**Cid**  
Yeah\!\!

He runs off.

**Barret**  
Yo, Cid\!  
When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Mr. leader, you'd better hurry.

**Yuffie**  
Cid......????  
I know you're all dyin' to talk to a babe like me\!  
But just leave me alone. This ship makes me...... urk...\!\!

**Bridge Crew Member 1**  
Good day, Captain\!

**Bridge Crew Member 2**  
Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, Captain......

**Pilot in training (LV5)**  
Eaggggghh\! Congrats' on becoming our leader, Cap'n\!

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here\!

**Cid**  
\- Fly Airship  
\- Chew the fat

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fly Airship</span>

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
Huh? Did I forget Cid? You're testing me on whether I forgot or not\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Chew the fat</span>

**Crew Member outside Operation Room**  
I'm not just shooting the breeze\! I'm also working\!

</div>

**Barret**  
Yo, Mr. Leader\! Get your pilot ass up here\!

**Nanaki**  
Cid.  
Let's visit Cloud and Tifa from time to time.

**Cait Sith**  
Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor......  
I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was that......?

**Vincent**  
Cid...... I wish I had your go-get-them attitude.  
It appears my feelings vanished into thin air ever since I was in that long slumber......

**Pilot in training (LV6)**  
Yaah\! Shall we take off?

**Cid**  
\- Yes  
\- No

**Pilot in training (LV6)**  
Yaah\! We're taking off\!

**Cid**  
Well, let's see...... What's a good place to head to?  
Corel? Fort Condor?

### North Corel - Huge Materia

#### [Return to North Corel](#return)

#### [Back on the Highwind](#highwind)

---

Around the world there is now some awareness of the Huge Materia plans. At Kalm...

**Redhead**  
Hey, listen to me\! The Shinra troops are on the move.  
The TV news said Rufus came up with 2 plans. One, is to launch a rocket into space containing Huge Materia......  
Is Huge Materia really that destructive?

At Lower Junon, on entering Priscilla's house...

**Priscilla**  
Who are you---?

**Cid**  
We found Cloud\!

**Priscilla**  
I'm so happy\!\! Someday I'm going to be Cloud's wife.  
I've decided I'm gonna be Cloud's wife.

In Upper Junon...

**Soldier on the Path to the Airport**  
Right now the Shinra's using it to gather the Huge Materia from the Corel Reactor and from the Fort Condor Reactor.  
The Gelnika's flying all over the place\! The only one that's not busy, is probably me\!

**1st Soldier at the Airport**  
The President is gathering up all the Huge Materia on the planet. He wants to shoot it at Meteor in the rocket.  
President Rufus is different from the older generation. He'll protect the planet with all of the technology Shinra currently has.

**2nd Soldier at the Airport**  
Protect? No, I don't think so. The President isn't the type to do anything so heroic. It's all just a game--a question of winning or losing--to him...

On the path to the Underwater Reactor, where the soldiers are drilling...

**Commander**  
Our forces are in the process of gathering the Huge Materia from the Corel and the Fort Condor Reactors\!  
Once these two missions are completed, the Underwater Reactor will be our next target\!  
Till then, we do nothing but train, train, train\!

At Gongaga...

**Old Man**  
This reactor's useless, but I hear there's still big materia at the Corel, Fort Condor, and the Junon reactors.  
Shinra's working to get the materia from all those places...... But for what...?

**Redhead**  
Seems like the Shinra is planning something big to destroy Meteor...  
I heard they're going to do something with all that big materia they've been gathering...  
After what happened with the reactor you can't trust Shinra.

At Cosmo Canyon...

**Bugenhagen**  
You are using Shinra materia, as a weapon?  
Materia is highly dense spiritual energy. A shred of the planet's life. It should not be used as a weapon.  
We must stop using it... or the planet will become weakened.

---

At Corel...

**Man**  
Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia.  
I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor.

**Big Man**  
Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor\!  
Ya think they can really do it...? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits\!

<span id="arrival"></span>Cid and the others travel through the mountains to the Corel Reactor.

**Soldier**  
You guys are...\!

They fight and defeat the two soldiers guarding the door.

**Cid**  
Guess we're safe for now...\!

A train whistle sounds.

> **Barret**  
> Da---mn\!

> **Nanaki**  
> Ohh\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Wa... wait\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Wha... what is it, what is it\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> \!\!

They get out of the way as a train exits the reactor.

**Cid**  
Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that train\!

> **Barret**  
> NO\! You damn boneheads\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Did the Shinra beat us\!?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> What are ya gonna do\!? Huge Materia\!?
>
> **Cait Sith**

>
> **Vincent**  
> ...go after them?

**Cid**  
Hey, do you know who I am?  
I'm Cid - that's who the hell I am\! Now just let me handle it\!

They run inside the reactor and another whistle sounds.

**Cid**  
Hey, hey, hey, hey---\!

They come out riding a shorter train.

> **Barret**  
> How can they even drive this?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> It sure helped having Cid here. I had no idea he could drive a train...
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Pretty good for an old guy. I'm impressed you can move this thing\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Way to go, Mister\! You used to drivin' this thing too?
>
> **Vincent**  
> I'm impressed. You can drive this too...?

**Cid**  
Don't ask me... I don't know\!

> **Barret**  
> What\!?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Wa...What\!?

> **Yuffie**  
> What\!? You serious\!?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Huh? What'd you just say\!?
>
> **Vincent**  
> Wha... what...\!?

**Cid**  
Don't worry\! I can handle this kinda stuff\!  
Two levers; one on the right and one on the left...  
I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right\!?  
Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.  
We're gonna fly\!\! Hold on tight\!\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight"><span id="return"></span>If they fail to catch up to Shinra's train...</span>

**Cid**  
DAMN\!  
Sorry\! I couldn't catch up to them\!

They walk into North Corel, which is unharmed.

**Cid**  
Sorry... I never shoulda gave that Huge Materia to the Shinra so easily...

> **Barret**  
> Can't keep regrettin' the past... It's the future we gotta think about now.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they catch up to Shinra's train in time...</span>

**Cid**  
All right\! We're gonna jump\!\!

They jump to the other train and fight their way to the front.

**Soldier Driving**  
What the\! You... you guys\!

**Cid**  
All right--- Just hand over the Huge Materia\!

**Soldier Driving**  
Sh......  
Whooooa----\!

They fight off the soldier.

**Cid**  
You got guts comin' after me\!  
I'll never forget you\!

> **Barret**  
> Got no time for that now\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> We got it going, but what about the brakes?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Forget about the Huge Materia, WE'RE the ones in deep trouble\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> What are we gonna do, kill off the engineer\!?
>
> **Vincent**  
> Hit the brakes, Chief.

**Cid**  
I KNOW, already\! Just shut up and keep quiet\! If we keep this up, we'll crash right into North Corel\!  
Let's see... If we alternately use the levers to accelerate, ...  
It should brake if we move the levers up or down simultaneously\!

> **Barret**  
> Hey, it's not working\!
>
> **Nanaki**

> Hey---------WAIT\! ...other way, other way, other way\!

> **Vincent**

**Cid**  
@\#\*\#\! The other way\!? Just watch, this time, I'll...

The train stops just at the entrance to North Corel.

**Older Woman**  
You sure are brave. I'm impressed\!

**Man**  
You guys are really something\!

**Big Man**  
Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?  
The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again...

**Man**  
To you it may be a junk yard, but to us its home.

If Barret is in the party, he will instead say:

It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, Barret\!\!

**Barret**  
Of... of course\! We're all born and raised in the coal mines\!\!  
No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like coal\!

**Man**  
To hell with Meteor\! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?  
We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor\!

**Big Man**  
That's it\!  
Hey, kid\! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fightin' the Shinra?

A kid comes down from above.

Must've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your body.  
I already talked to the Inn's owner, today you can rest for free.

Cid and the others spend the night.

The next day, inside the crumbling house...

**Man**  
I don't want to die, but who can stop Meteor?

**Woman**  
Is Meteor really going to crash down on us......?  
I'm still young...... I'll never marry again.  
This memento is all I have left of my husband... I'll give it to you if you'll please stop Meteor...

Back outside...

If you're comin' down, then hurry up do it\!\! 'Cause I'm gonna kick the $\#@& outta ya\!

**Big Man**  
I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to happen.

Inside a tent...

**Old Man**  
What the? Don't get hit by the train\!

**Black Woman**  
With Meteor coming, I guess it won't make any difference...

In another tent...

**Woman**  
You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway...

The train crashes into North Corel. Cid comes to in the inn, rolling off the bed.

**Innkeeper**  
You all right?  
Some townspeople carried you here so the Shinra wouldn't find you.  
How much more will they have to destroy before they're satisfied\!?  
Isn't anyone brave enough to stick it to Shinra?

Cid and the others step outside to see the damage.

Even the Gold Saucer is closing. So does that mean there's no time to be playing around?

Inside the crumbling house...

**Man**  
The town is in shambles...... and Meteor is falling our way...

God, what have we done...?  
Well, no use just sitting around talking about it. What can we do to get things back to normal?

**Man 2**  
While you guys were relaxing, Shinra troops took the Huge Materia.

**Old Man**  
Um... where was the next train station?

**Black Woman**  
Seeing that train got Grandpa more excited than I've seen him for some time.

**Kid**

If you went to Fort Condor before going to Corel, the party stops to talk before leaving.

**Cid**  
There's only one more Huge Materia the Shinra needs... That's the one at the Underwater Reactor.

<span id="highwind"></span>Back on the Highwind...

**Cid**  
What's next? Shall we head for Fort Condor?

**Barret**  
Huh? Mr. Leader, what's next\!?

**Nanaki**  
We'll do our best for Cloud and you.  
......And Aeris, too.

**Vincent**  
......Don't expect anything else from me except fighting beside you.  
I don't have any comforting words.  
Of course, I don't believe you're the type of guy who needs kindness from other's......

### Fort Condor - Huge Materia

---

Because Fort Condor is optional until this point, it is possible for this to be the party's first visit.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If this is the party's first visit to Fort Condor...</span>

**Man**  
We've been fighting the Shinra for a long time at this battlefield.  
Even now, we're still settled in for a long war with them.  
If you aren't in a hurry, would you help us fight them?  
Listen, we don't want to push you but, if you're in the middle of something, why don't you finish that first?

**Cid**  
\- Like to help but...  
\- I guess we'll help you

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Like to help but...</span>

**Man**  
All right then...... Take care of yourselves...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I guess we'll help you</span>

**Man**  
Really\!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.

</div>

Cid and the others go inside. They find the man by himself in the shed at the top of the fort, looking out the window.

**Man**  
Do you guys want to see it, too?

**Cid**  
What is it?

**Man**  
The condors. They're huge. Come on, have a look.

Cid has a look out the window, seeing a huge condor nesting close to the Mako reactor that sits atop Fort Condor's hill.

**Man**  
What do ya think? Awesome, huh?

**Man with Hat**  
Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.  
Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd better get down before you get involved.

**Cid**  
A battlefield, we can't overlook that.

> **Barret**  
> Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Shinra again.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> The Shinra? Here too?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> ......
>
> **Vincent**  
> What do you mean by that?

**Man with Hat**  
It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here.  
Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?

**Cid**  
All right, talk on\!

**Man with Hat**  
Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?

> **Barret**  
> Huh? Something's up there?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Look close, old man.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Yeah, come to think of it there was something.

**Cid**  
No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of it, is that the Condor?

**Man with Hat**  
I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a condor.  
Looks like there's a special materia up in the Mako reactor.  
Then came the condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid of it.  
Their plan is to get rid of the condor and the people on this mountain and to get the materia from the Mako Reactor.  
Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.  
That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.  
As our sponsor you can help us with a contribution or by fighting along side of us...  
What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?

**Cid**  
If you go that far, what can I say. Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us.

> **Barret**  
> Hey\! We'll come to the rescue.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the materia, right?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Well then, let's do our best.
>
> **Vincent**  
> That's the right decision.

**Man with Hat**  
I'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed and the condors from being killed.

They go on up to the shack.

**Man**  
So shall I let you in on our strategy?  
The enemy is targeting this mountain's reactor and will be climbing to reach it.  
We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect this place.  
Well, this is all we have...... this village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, our hands are tied 'cause we're broke.  
To hire one soldier, we need 400 gil. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we must have 8000 gil.  
That is, we would like you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the trap, set it up and give the commands.  
We know that we're asking is selfish. We sent our wives and kids to another village. We are resigned to our fate.  
Let's get back to square one. If the enemy penetrates this shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately.  
I know it's a one shot deal, but I'm asking for your help.  
Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?

**Cid**  
\- Enough

**Man**  
Ready?

**Cid**  
\- Wait  
\- [Okay, ready](#ready)  
\- Hear more

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the party has visited Fort Condor before...</span>

**Man with Hat**  
You've come at a good time. Shinra's changing its strategy now.  
It seems that Shinra will destroy the reactor and then take out the materia that's inside.

> **Barret**  
> Man, we're walking on dangerous ground. We can't lose now\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> We can't afford to be beaten\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> If we lose here, all the materia we gathered will be for nothing.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> You're right. If we lose here, we'll be in great danger.
>
> **Vincent**  
> We must protect this area.

**Cid**  
Damn\! I guess we have to protect this area, too.

They go on up to the shack.

**Man**  
The situation has changed. Looks like the enemy is set to attack. If we lose here, it's over.  
Our lives are in your hands. We're counting on you.  
Ready?

**Cid**  
\- Wait  
\- [Okay, ready](#ready)  
\- Hear more

</div>

<span id="ready"></span>Once the party agrees to fight...

**Man**  
This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever before.

If Fort Condor has funds remaining, he will add:

Let's give them all the gil we have.

A lengthy battle with Shinra troops ensues.

<div class="block">

If Cid and the others defeat the Shinra...

**Man**  
YES\! We did it\! That was wonderful\! Thank you\!\! I doubt Shinra will attack now.

He laughs, then looks outside.

A, arrgghh......

Outside, the condor's egg begins to crack, there is a blaze of light, and the condor falls from atop the reactor. The egg hatches.

**Man**  
Th, that light just now......  
The condor......  
The eggs......  
What\!?  
Would you go outside and see what it was?

Cid goes outside to investigate. He picks up the Phoenix materia and watches the hatchling condor fly off. Cid goes back inside.

**Man**  
Gone...  
Be sure and report to my father, too.  
Oh, it's you. Thanks a lot.

Cid goes down to report to the father.

**Man with Hat**  
Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks.  
Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure you can stop in and stay any time, so be sure to drop by.  
Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you......

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received key item "Huge Materia"\!

</div>

**Cid**  
Huh? What's this?

> **Barret**  
> Damn man, it's Huge Materia.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Gotta have that materia\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hmm, you mean this?
>
> **Vincent**  
> This is......

**Man with Hat**  
The truth is, this is the materia inside the reactor.

**Cid**  
What the hell did we fight for?

**Man with Hat**  
We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the condors.  
When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how we knew what was inside the reactor.  
I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked in and took the materia.  
I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. I'm really sorry.

**Cid**  
Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.

**Man with Hat**  
I see. If you put it that way...... we're really grateful.

**Cid**  
So the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater reactor in Junon?

> **Barret**  
> We gotta get there first and beat 'em no matter what\!

> **Nanaki**  
> We must get there before them and stop them\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> We gotta get there and stop 'em...
>
> **Vincent**  
> Getting to the reactor before them...

**Cid**  
But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always mess with 'em.  
How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a bit?

> **Barret**  
> You mus' mean Cloud......
>
> **Nanaki**  
> You mean, Cloud...?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Cloud, right...?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> You must mean Mr. Cloud......

**Cid**  
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout Tifa; she may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.  
How 'bout checkin' in on 'em\! Down to Mideel\!

</div>

<div class="block">

If the party loses the battle...

Cid comes back inside the shack and falls over.

**Man**  
...... Even if you could only spare them......

The party comes to at the bottom of Fort Condor and slowly gets up.

**Cid**  
God\! What the hell happened here\!?

**Cid**  
It's Huge Materia that the Shinra's after...... The only one left is in the underwater reactor in Junon.

**Cid**  
Yeah, but ever since we got in their way the last time, they should've gotten a little more cautious.  
I doubt they'll fly right into action. I'm more concerned about him that anything else.

The others nod.

On returning to the Highwind, if you haven't gone to North Corel yet...

**Cid**  
Where shall we go next? Shall we head for the Corel reactor?

Otherwise:

**Cid**  
Hey......  
It's tough being the leader.  
Cloud did a great job. Sheesh......  
Shall we go to Mideel to check on things?

**Barret**  
Yo, wanna see what Tifa and the gang are doing?

**Nanaki**  
Say Cid.  
I wonder how Tifa and Cloud...... are doing.

**Cait Sith**  
Shinra's...... stopped.  
Now we've got to be careful. I know Heidegger and his gang are plotting something.

**Vincent**  
You look really tired, maybe you're ready to give up being leader?

**Pilot in training (LV7)**  
Yaaah\! Shall we take off?

**Cid**  
\- Roger  
\- Negative

**Pilot in training (LV7)**  
Man\! We're taking off\!

On returning to the Highwind's bridge afterwards...

**Nanaki**  
I wonder how Cloud's doing.  
I wonder if Tifa needs a break......  
I could look after him instead.

**Old Man at Entrance**  
Ahoy\! This here's Mideel. A quiet Hot Springs town... At least it used to be...  
Lately the sea's been in a tizzy. Lifestream has been mixin' things up at the bottom of the ocean.  
I think the planet's pretty angry too. We've pretty much done whatever we've wanted to the planet up till now.

**Woman**  
It's bad enough with earthquakes and Meteor, but on top of all that now the Lifestream has become active again, too.  
I hope it doesn't blow and cause a panic like it did before. That was really bad, I tell ya.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you obtained and used the Beat-up Useless Old Key as Tifa...</span>

In the Weapons Shop, Cid inspects the door.

**Cid**  
Damn, why the hell did they make something tricky like this?

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you did not obtain the Beat-up Useless Old Key...</span>

Walking over the key, there is a clinking noise.

**Cid**  
Huh...? The hell's this?  
Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside, and I can't get it out.  
Well, what the hell? That's life...

In the Weapons Shop, Cid kicks the door.

**Cid**  
No good... Someone must've locked it.

He returns to the key.

**Cid**  
Okay, there's gotta be a way to get it out.  
Maybe if I move this a bit...... and push that over...... HAH\! Gotcha\!

Or, if he didn't notice the key earlier:

Hey......what's that? Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside and

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received a "Beat-up Useless Old Key"\!

</div>

Back to the Weapons Shop, Cid again inspects the door...

**Cid**  
Hey, I know what'll do it... Let's try that beat up old key\!  
\- Use the beat up old key\!  
\- Forget it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Use the beat up old key\!</span>

Yeah, this is it.  
Huh? Wha...? Won't turn...  
Wha......\!?  
Hoo, \*&%$^% Busted it... Can't get the damn thing out...

**Shopkeeper**  
Is something wrong......?

**Cid**  
Ulp\!\!  
Oh, uh, no, uh I......  
Damn, this's bad...  
\- What the hell... lie\!  
\- Just apologize and get it over with\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">What the hell... lie\!</span>

Er, nothin'. Hah, hah. That's one nice door you got there, y'know.

**Shopkeeper**  
Oh... why, thank you very much.

**Cid**  
Phew... that was a close one. But I kinda feel a little bad about that one......

Cid looks at the door.

............ The key's broken off inside, and I can't get to it......  
............ I don't know a thing about it...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Just apologize and get it over with\!</span>

Mmm..., sorry\! I twisted the ^%$\#^ and broke it.

**Shopkeeper**  
Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?

Cid nods.

**Shopkeeper**  
Hah, hah, hah\! That's a good one\!

**Cid**  
???

**Shopkeeper**  
Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.

**Cid**  
Say what? You drew that door on the wall?

**Shopkeeper**  
That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.  
Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.

**Cid**  
Oh, uh... well Thanks.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Cid and the others received "Cursed Ring"\!

</div>

**Shopkeeper**  
If possible, we're hoping to pass through a dream door like that one into another world  
I got the feeling that you all might be able to make my dreams come true in my place. Weird, isn't it?

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Forget it</span>

Naw, forget it... It doesn't even look like it fits.

</div>

</div>

If Cid is carrying Mimett Greens, he can talk to the white chocobo following the shopper.

**Cid**  
What's this\!? Your bein' awful friendly.  
Oh, so that's it. You want the Samolen Greens... don't you?  
\- Give it some Samolen Greens  
\- Don't give it any

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Give it some Samolen Greens</span>

**Cid**  
Well, guess there's no way around it. Here ya go, shrimp. Eat up.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks like it enjoyed eating the Greens.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If the party hasn't obtained the chocobo's materia...</span>

**Cid**  
Heh heh, hey he's kinda cute. Aw, maybe I'll just tickle him a little.  
\- Tickle his feet  
\- Tickle his stomach  
\- Tickle his neck  
\- Tickle his belly button  
\- Tickle behind his ears  
\- Tickle under his arms

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tickle his feet</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

The chocobo looks like it loves that.

The chocobo looks a little ticklish.

Sheesh, you scared me. I thought you croaked\!\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't give it any</span>

**Cid**  
Sorry, shorty. But I can't give ya any.

</div>

Inside a house...

**Old Man Playing with Dog**  
I gotta feelin' something bad's gonna happen. Is it gonna be okay?  
I'm all right. I've lived a long, full life.  
But I'm worried about my son and his family living in that far-off town...  
I hope they're safe...

Cid takes the elixir on his bed and starts for the door.

**Old Man Playing with Dog**  
Wait a minute.  
Did you take something just now?

The dog barks, and Cid jumps.

**Cid**  
Uh, oh. I'm......  
\- Yeah, I took it old man\!  
\- Don't know nothin' 'bout it\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yeah, I took it old man\!</span>

Hey, it's mine now\! An' I'll make good use of it, believe-you-me\!

**Old Man Playing with Dog**  
Heh, heh. What an oddball. We'll let him use it.

**Cid**  
Hey thanks. It'll help, pops\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't know nothin' 'bout it\!</span>

Wh, wh-huh...? I don't know nuthin' about that.

**Old Man Playing with Dog**  
What the hell happened to the rotten old elixir I was gonna throw out?  
If someone took that by mistake it'll do more than make them sick...  
Well, if you don't know then I guess you don't know.

**Cid**  
...............

</div>

Back outside...

**Old Man**  
So how is the boy? Poor kid. He sure got the worst of whatever it was......  
Sure hope he gets better soon. Right now is when he really needs to hold on and not give up.

**Bald Man**  
It's amazing he recovered. When they carried him here after they first discovered him, I thought for sure he was a goner.  
That boy must have one powerful guardian angel watchin' over him.

<span id="clinic"></span>At the clinic...

**Doctor**  
I'm sorry...... But your friend's condition remains unchanged......  
You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence.

**Nurse** (after one Huge Materia mission)  
Oh, hello. She always stays right by his side. She must really love him.  
Remember, even at a time like this you can never give up hope. You've got to be strong like her.

**Nurse** (after both missions)  
She's finally beginning to look a little tired... I hope she's all right.  
No change in his condition, and still she stays there doing her best. It must be tough on her.  
If she keeps this up she'll probably get sick......

**Nurse**  
Well anyhow...... Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?

Cid and the others rest whether they want to or not.

OK\! Perfect\! Well then, take care.

**Cloud**  
uh...... a...... aah......  
.........What...... What number...... am I?  
Uh...... aaa......?  
A billion mirror fragments...... small...... light......  
taken...... angel's...... singing voices............ zeno...... gias......  
Uh...... aaa......?

**Tifa** (after one Huge Materia mission)  
Cloud...... I don't understand a word he's saying......  
I'm such a fool...... I thought there was something that I could do for him......

**Tifa** (after both missions)  
......it's no use...... I don't understand a thing, Cloud.  
What should I do......? What if you never recover for the rest of your life?

The ground starts shaking and Tifa falls down.

**Tifa**  
Eyaaah\!?

**Cloud**  
......They're...... They're...... coming......\!\!

**Cid**  
What did you say, Cloud\!?

**Cloud**  
Uh...... aaa......?

**Cid**  
Damn. What the hell's goin' on\!?

**Tifa**  
No way...... Is this......\!?

**Doctor**  
This isn't good\!\! It's big\!

**Nurse**  
Eyaaah\! I hate earthquakes\!\!

Cid goes outside.

**Cid**  
What's this...\!?  
The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the earth\!

The sound of a monster screeching starts up.

**Cid**  
Damn, that's......\!? This is bad......\!\!

**Tifa** (at the door)  
Cid......\!? What's wrong?

**Cid**  
N, nothin'\!\! You and Cloud get inside quick\!\!

**Tifa**  
But I......\!?

**Cid**  
Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that easily.

**Tifa**  
Be careful...\!

**Cid**  
Okay, here I go\! Watch this\!\!

Cid and the others get ready to fight.

**Cid**  
Damn\!\! That &%$^%$ Weapon\!\!  
Of all the times to show up......\!  
OK then, come on\!\! You &$^%$\!

Ultima Weapon flies down to meet them. After a short battle, it flies off again.

**Cid**  
You &^$\#&$\#\! You tryin' to escape?

The quaking abates, and they all relax.

> **Barret**  
> Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I woudda smashed him......
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Just a little more and I would have beaten him.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> I swear, next time, that guy's dead meat\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> No matter how many lives I get, it ain't enough\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> Hmm...... Looks like escape is their best skill.

> **Barret**  
> Looks like the Lifestream's settled down now too.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Well at least the Lifestream's back to normal.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Looks like the Lifestream's back under control too.
>
> **Vincent**  
> And the Lifestream also appears to be normal.

The quaking starts up again.

**Cid**  
Damn, you gotta be kiddin'......\!\!  
Th, this's bad......\! The main stream is kickin' up\!\!  
Somethin' way bigger than that last one is on its way\!\!  
No good\!\! Get outta here......\!\!

> **Nanaki**  
> But what about Tifa and Cloud\!?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> But what about Tifa and Cloud......\!?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> But what about Cloud and the others......\!?

**Cid**  
Goddammit\!\!  
You don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself\! You don't know when that stream'll blow......  
Whoa\!\!  
There's no time, hurry\!\!

They run off. Cid turns back momentarily.

**Cid**  
Tifa\!\! Cloud\!\! Get outta here\!\!

Back to Tifa in the clinic...

**Tifa**  
This is bad...... The tremors are getting worse.  
Wait a minute, Cloud.  
Doctor\! Shouldn't we move him somewhere rather than stay here...?

**Doctor**  
Hmm...... It might be safer to take refuge in a wide open space.

**Tifa**  
Don't you worry about a thing, Cloud......  
I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe\!

**Doctor**  
No\! The structure can't take it\!\! Hurry\!

**Tifa**  
Yes\!  
Ready Cloud? We're leaving now\!\!

<span id="cloud"></span>She pushes Cloud out of the clinic on the wheelchair as the ground lifts up and falls into the Lifestream behind them, taking the town with it. Unable to make it to safety in time, she and Cloud both fall into the Lifestream.

Tifa wakes, sitting alone in the middle of a black screen, with the sound of dripping water.

**Tifa**  
Wh, where am I......? what's happening? I......?

She gets to her feet and looks around.

Where's Cloud......\!? Cloud, where are you\!?

Faint noises start up in the background, like static on a radio.

**Tifa**  
Huh...... what......? Who......?  
Who is it......? I can't hear......

Suddenly she turns around.

Wait a minute......\! I don't know anything about that\!  
No\! It's not me......\! I'd never do anything like that\!\!

She puts her hands to her head.

No\! Stop it......\!\! Stay back\!

She starts running.

Somebody...... help\! Please\!\!

The sounds grow louder and she falls to her knees.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, help me\!\!  
Eyaaaaghh......\!\!

Tifa comes to in a sort of nexus with three branching paths. An image of Cloud sits at the entrance to each of them.

**Tifa**  
............ Where am I......?

She looks up to where there is another Cloud overhead, clutching his head and writhing in pain.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!?  
What is it, Cloud? What is this......\!?  
Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it...... your...... subconsciousness......?  
You're searching, aren't you Cloud?  
Searching...... for yourself......  
I can help too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back\!  
But...... Where do we start......?

\* **Note**: It should be noted that the dialogue boxes belonging to Cloud's mind fragments are not labeled with his name during this section.

**Cloud** (sitting by the well)  
That starry night at the well...... The promise we made that night...... What if that memory was all a lie?

**Cloud** (sitting outside the window)  
............ a sealed up secret...... wish......  
Tender feelings...... that no one can ever know......

<span id="nibelheim"></span>Tifa walks up to the Cloud near the gates to Nibelheim.

**Cloud**  
The gates of Nibelheim... Five years ago, Sephiroth passed through these gates......  
And...... That's how it all started......

**Tifa**  
It connects...... to Nibelheim......?  
That's right... It's probably best to start from there......  
Let's go have a look, Cloud. I know it's not easy...... But I'll be right with you......

Tifa walks up to the gate into Nibelheim.

**Tifa**  
Cloud... look.  
Here's the well...  
And that's Gramps' Inn, too.  
The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?  
This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?  
It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this place is...... our Nibelheim.

Cloud appears sitting near the truck.

**Tifa**  
Five Years ago... two men from SOLDIER came...  
Sephiroth and...... a young and vibrant soldier.  
Can you tell me again what happened?

<div class="highlight">

Sephiroth appears and turns to talk to someone behind him.

**Sephiroth**  
How does it feel?

**Tifa**  
Five Years ago... I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.

**Sephiroth**  
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?  
So how does it feel?  
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown...

**Cloud**  
Ummm... how 'bout your parents?

**Tifa**  
So this is... the Great Sephiroth.

**Sephiroth**  
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father...

**Tifa**  
But to tell you the truth, I thought he was very cold.

**Sephiroth**  
What does it matter...?  
All right, let's go.

**Tifa**  
I remember, I felt a foreboding about him.

She watches as Cloud and the two soldiers enter the village. The Cloud-image moves to stand with the Cloud in the memory. Tifa shakes her head.

**Tifa**  
No, Cloud.  
I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you... something terrible might happen.  
But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.

Sephiroth and the soldiers disappear.

**Tifa**  
You weren't here. Cloud did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.

A flash. A 15-year-old Tifa sits waiting just past the gate.

**Tifa**  
I... waited. But, Cloud... never came.  
The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person...

The young Tifa gets up to see who's coming. She shakes her head and runs off. Sephiroth reappears at the gate.

**Sephiroth**  
All right, let's go.

The two soldiers enter, along with a black-haired SOLDIER. Fade to white.

</div>

**Cloud**  
You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth wasn't...... Cloud......?

**Tifa**  
There's nothing...... I can say......  
You must find the answer yourself......  
If you can't...... Then you......  
Take your time, Cloud. Slowly...... little by little, okay?

The Cloud-image sits down. Tifa walks to the second Cloud, who sits in front of the well.

**Cloud**  
That starry night at the well...... And our promise that night... What if the memory was just a lie?

**Tifa**  
Don't hurry, Cloud...... Don't answer too quickly.  
Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back...... Slowly...... little by little.......  
Right... like the sky that night...... the heavens were filled with stars......

Fade to black.

**Tifa**  
From the beginning... OK?

A starlit Nibelheim fades into view. Cloud and Tifa stand on the well.

**Tifa**  
Try and remember, Cloud.

A young Cloud and Tifa appear sitting at the well.

**Tifa**  
Right, I was wearing these clothes.  
That's you, too. You were so small then......

She sits down beside her younger self and looks over at Cloud.

...and cute.  
Sephiroth once said...  
Cloud made up his memories by listening to my stories...  
Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it.  
That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just Cloud and I. We talked at the well...  
That's why I continued to believe that you were the real Cloud.  
I still believe you're the Cloud from Nibelheim...  
But you don't believe in yourself...  
These memories aren't enough.

Fade to white. They return to the nexus.

<span id="mountain"></span>**Tifa**  
Cloud, what about your other memories?  
No, not memories.  
A memory is something that has to be consciously recalled, right?  
That's why sometimes it can be mistaken and a different thing......  
But it's different from a memory locked deep within your heart......  
That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory......  
That's it\! What about some memory that has to do with me?  
I say something and you don't remember it......  
But you say something, and I remember it, too... Then we'll know that's our memory......  
Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you...  
Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?  
I always thought it was a sudden decision you made......

......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.

**Cloud**  
......I was devastated. ......I wanted to be noticed.  
I thought if I got stronger I could get someone to notice......

**Tifa**  
Someone to notice you...? ......who?

Who......? ......You know who\! ......You, that's who.

**Cloud**  
You......

**Tifa**  
......Me? Why\!?

**Young Cloud**  
Tifa...... did you forget...... about those days?

Tifa turns to look as a much younger Cloud appears.

**Tifa**  
Look...... I......  
I'm sorry...... But what are you talking about?

**Young Cloud**  
No...... it's all right. You were having a hard time back then.  
You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me back then.

Tifa walks over to join him.

**Tifa**  
'Back then'?

**Young Cloud**  
It's important to me...... I hate to say it but... It's a very important memory......  
Do you want to see it?

**Cloud** (sitting by the well)  
A promise under a starry sky... But what if even that was a memory that Tifa imagined......?

**Young Cloud**  
Come on, hurry.

Tifa goes over to talk to the third and final Cloud.

**Cloud**  
......a sealed up secret...... wish......  
Tender memories...... no one can ever know......

He steps aside to let Tifa and the young Cloud pass.

**Young Cloud**  
Do you know where this window goes to, Tifa?  
Fine...... I'll go.

They look through the window into Tifa's bedroom. Tifa and the young Cloud now stand in the bedroom, while an adult Cloud sits in the corner by her dresser.

**Tifa**  
My room?

**Young Cloud**  
It was my first time there.

**Tifa**  
Was... it?

**Young Cloud**  
I only used to look up at it from outside.

<div class="highlight">

A flash, and a young Tifa is sitting on the floor near her window with a trio of boys around her.

**Boy**  
Hey, look\!  
Cloud's coming\!

Out the window, they see Cloud approach the house.

**Boy**  
You think he wants to come in?

Young Tifa looks up and shakes her head.

**Tifa**  
Was that the first day you came into my room?  
...that's right.  
We lived next to each other.  
But I really didn't know you that well.  
I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close...  
Now that you mention it... I don't recall you ever being in my room...

**Young Cloud**  
Tifa always used to be with this three-some.

**Tifa**  
...That's right.

**Young Cloud**  
I used to think... they were all stupid.

**Tifa**  
What\!?

**Young Cloud**  
You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing.

**Tifa**  
But we were children, back then.

**Young Cloud**  
...I know. I'm the one that was stupid.  
I really wanted to play with everyone, but I was never allowed into the group.  
Then later... I began to think I was different...  
That I was different from those immature kids.  
That then... maybe...

Another image of Cloud separates from the adult Cloud sitting in the corner, and stands up.

Just maybe, they would invite me in.  
I thought that might happen, so I hung around...

**Young Cloud**  
I was so prejudiced. And... weak.

That night I called Tifa out to the well...  
I thought to myself Tifa would never come... that she hated me.

**Tifa**  
Yeah... it was so sudden. I was... a bit surprised.  
But...  
It's true that we weren't THAT close, but...  
After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.  
I used to wonder how Cloud was doing.  
I wonder if Cloud was able to get into SOLDIER?  
I started reading the newspapers, thinking that there might be an article about you.

**Young Cloud**  
Thanks, Tifa.  
Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy.

**Tifa**  
OK\!  
Huh?  
What happened on this day? Was it a special day?

**Young Cloud**  
This was the day...

Tifa's mother...

Fade to white.

**Tifa**  
The day Mom died...

Back to the young Tifa on the floor.

**Tifa**  
I want... to see... mom...

She gets to her feet and runs from her room. She and the three boys gather at the base of Mt. Nibel.

**Tifa**  
...I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?

**Boys**  
Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there.  
No one crosses that mountain alive...

**Tifa**  
How 'bout those that died?  
Did mama pass through the mountains?

She starts up the path.

I'm going\!

The three boys watch her. Two start after her, but the third hesitates and runs away. Cloud runs up in time to watch him go, then starts after Tifa. When the kids reach the bridge, the other two boys run back. Cloud steps aside to let them pass, then follows Tifa across the bridge.

Later... Young Tifa and Cloud lie on the ground, having fallen from the mountain.

**Cloud**  
I don't remember the path I walked.  
Tifa missed her step. I ran to her... but didn't make it in time.  
Both of us fell off the cliff.  
Back then, I only scarred my knees but......

Tifa's father and another man run up to the pair. The other man gathers Tifa while Tifa's father stands over Cloud shaking a finger.

**Tifa's Father**  
Cloud\! Why'd you bring Tifa to a place like this\!  
What the hell's the matter with you\!?  
What if she dies\!?

He and the other man walk off, leaving Cloud behind.

**Cloud**  
Tifa was in a coma for seven days.  
We all thought she wouldn't make it.  
If only I could've saved her...  
I was so angry... Angry at myself for my weakness.  
Ever since then, I felt Tifa blamed me...  
I got out of control... I'd get into fights not even caring who it was.

Fade to black.

</div>

**Cloud**  
That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth.  
If I got strong like Sephiroth, then everyone might...

They return to the nexus.

**Cloud**  
If I could just get stronger...... Then even Tifa would have to notice me......

**Tifa**  
So that was it......  
Sorry, Cloud.  
If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner......

**Cloud**  
It's not your fault, Tifa.

<span id="truth"></span>**Tifa**  
But, I remember back when we were eight\!  
That's it\! Now I know\!  
You weren't created five years ago.  
My childhood memories weren't all made up\!  
Hang in there Cloud\! Just a little longer\! You've almost found the real you\!  
Let's go back to Nibelheim again......\!

Cloud runs off to the gates of Nibelheim and Tifa follows.

**Cloud**  
The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the palm of our hands.

They run through Nibelheim. Tifa stops as they pass Cloud's house.

**Tifa**  
Cloud, wait.  
Where are you going?

\* **Note**: At this point, Cloud's dialogue boxes are labeled with his name again.

**Cloud**  
......The reactor......?  
To the reactor\! The Mako reactor of five years ago\!

<div class="highlight">

Inside the reactor, Tifa is attacking Sephiroth. He cuts her, and she flies back down the stairs just as the black-haired SOLDIER runs in.

**Tifa**  
Hey\! It's Cloud\!

The door opens into Jenova's chamber, and Sephiroth goes inside.

**Cloud**  
Za...... ck...... Zac......k. Zack...

**Tifa**  
You remembered\!\!

Zack runs after Sephiroth.

**Tifa**  
That's right\! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth\!  
Then, where were you, Cloud?

Zack flies back out of Jenova's chamber. He lands on one of the pods and doesn't move.

**Tifa**  
Cloud... Did you... see it all?

**Cloud**  
I saw... everything...

A masked soldier runs in and takes Zack's sword. He runs up the steps into the Jenova chamber and on up the tube towards Sephiroth. Sephiroth turns around just as Cloud stabs him.

**Sephiroth**  
Aaarrrgh...... who... who are you?

**Soldier**  
Mom... Tifa...... my town... give it back...  
I had so much respect for you... I admired you...

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!?

After backing down from Jenova, the soldier pulls off his mask to reveal Cloud beneath it.

**Tifa**  
That's what happened...

The scene changes to show the party stopping to look at the Mako fountain on Mt. Nibel, the masked soldier standing behind Tifa.

**Tifa**  
...You were there.  
You were watching me.

Outside the Mako reactor, the soldier blocks Tifa from entering.

**Tifa**  
Yeah, I remember.  
Hmm... so it was you.

The scene cuts to the truck heading for Nibelheim. Rain pounds outside.

**Zack**  
Hey Cloud, if you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask off?

**Cloud**  
Yeah......

**Cloud**  
Yeah... This is... me.  
I... never made it as a member of SOLDIER.  
I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, but...  
I was so embarrassed...... I didn't want to see anybody...

Entering Nibelheim, Cloud sees Tifa, and turns away to put his mask back on. Zack looks at him sympathetically. Tifa stands up, and not seeing Cloud, she shakes her head and runs away.

**Sephiroth**  
How does it feel?  
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?

**Cloud**  
I'm...

While Nibelheim is burning, the soldier lying on the ground outside Cloud's house twitches and struggles to get up.

At the reactor, Cloud runs back down from Jenova's chamber to help Tifa.

**Tifa**  
...You came. ...You kept your promise.  
So you really did come when I was in trouble\!

**Cloud**  
Sorry... I didn't get there... fast enough...

**Tifa**  
It's all right... Cloud.

Sephiroth comes out of Jenova's chamber, sword in one hand, Jenova's head in the other.

**Sephiroth**  
Just like you.

He limps down the stairs, pauses to look at Jenova's head, and continues out of the room. Cloud gets up and starts after him.

**Zack**  
Cloud... Kill Sephiroth...

Cloud runs off, confronting Sephiroth on the bridge over the Mako pit.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth\!\!

Sephiroth turns and impales him on the Masamune.

**Sephiroth**  
Don't... push... your luck...

He lifts Cloud on the sword. Cloud looks down and grabs the end of the blade.

**Sephiroth**  
...It can't be\!

Cloud manages to get his feet back on the bridge, lifts up Sephiroth, and flings him aside into the Mako pit.

</div>

Cloud and Tifa return to the nexus.

**Tifa**  
Cloud......

**Young Cloud**  
Then... this is goodbye, Tifa. Until we meet again......

All the Clouds get to their feet.

**Tifa**  
............\!?

The Clouds meet in the center of the nexus and join one by one. Finally, the writhing Cloud comes down from above to join them. A single Cloud falls to the ground, and Tifa crouches next to him.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!\!

**Cloud**  
Uh...... Ah, Uh......\!

He solidifies and sits up.

Uh...... Tifa......

**Tifa**  
Oh, Cloud......\! It's really you, isn't it?

**Cloud**  
Yeah...... Tifa...... We finally...... meet again......

They both get to their feet.

**Tifa**  
You stupid jerk\!\! You had us all worried sick\!\!

Cloud collapses again, clutching his head.

**Cloud**  
Krgh......\!

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!? Are you all right\!?

**Cloud**  
V, voice...... Their......

**Tifa**  
I see. We're... in the Lifestream aren't we?  
Everyone's waiting.  
Let's go back, Cloud. Back to everyone......

**Cloud**  
Yeah, I guess so... Come on, Tifa. Let's go home......

Together they swim upward out of the Lifestream.

<span id="lifestream"></span>Tifa comes to just outside what used to be Mideel. Everyone is gathered around her and Cloud.

**Barret**  
Yo\! You awright\!? Tifa\!?

**Tifa**  
u... unn......?

She props herself up on an arm.

Barret... You came back. I......  
Cloud... Where is he?

**Barret**  
Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.

**Tifa**  
Barret...... I...... When I was in the Lifestream I saw the real Cloud.  
I mean, I didn't really find him. Cloud found himself on his own...

**Barret**  
Awright, I know... I shouldn't have doubted him.  
But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.

Tifa lies back.

**Tifa**  
People have so many things pent up inside of themselves...  
And they can forget so many things......  
Strange...... isn't it............

**Barret**  
Yo, Tifa\! Snap outta it\!\!  
Tifa......\!?

---

Back on the Highwind, everyone is gathered in the Operations Room.

**Cloud**  
Everyone...... I'm sorry. I don't know what to say......

**Nanaki**  
Don't say anything, Cloud. All you've been doing is apologizing.

**Cloud**  
I never was in SOLDIER.  
I made up the stories about what happened to me five years ago, about being in SOLDIER.  
I left my village looking for glory, but never made it in to SOLDIER......  
I was so ashamed of being so weak; then I heard this story from my friend Zack...  
And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life......  
And I continued to play the charade as if it were true.

**Barret**  
Illusion, huh...? Pretty damn strong for a 'lusion, I'd say.

**Cloud**  
I'm physically built like someone in SOLDIER.  
Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult.  
It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.  
You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.  
Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells......  
For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER.  
It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.  
But weak people...... like me, get lost in the whole thing.  
The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.  
Everyone knew that. I'm...... Cloud.  
......the master of my own illusionary world.  
But I can't remain trapped in an illusion any more......  
I'm going to live my life without pretending.

**Tifa**  
You're sure messed up, Cloud\!

**Barret**  
That means there ain't no difference from before\!

Cloud scratches his head.

**Cait Sith**  
By the way, Cloud. What are you going to do now?  
Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?

**Cloud**  
......I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us.  
That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this thing.

**Barret**  
Good\!\! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the planet\!?

**Cloud**  
It's like you always told me, Barret.

**Barret**  
Oh, uh, you mean that\!

**Nanaki**  
What? I don't understand\!

**Cloud**  
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on\!

**Tifa**  
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on\!

**Barret**  
The train we on don't make no stops\!

Everyone laughs and runs out, Barret chasing after them, leaving Cloud behind.

**Crew Member**  
Oh...... oh...... Cloud......

Cloud turns for the door.

**Crew Member**  
Cloud, I was deeply moved by your story\!  
I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you feel, Cloud\!  
No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready\!

On the bridge...

**Cait Sith**  
Listen, Cloud.  
We're right in the middle of the mission for the Huge Materia, right?  
I know this's kinda outta the blue, but there's a underwater reactor at Junon.  
As far as I can see, that's the only one left.  
That's that. Let's go\!

**Barret**  
C'mon, Cloud\! Don't \#&$\* around\!  
We're goin' to Junon, boyeee\!\!

**Tifa**  
Let's do our best, Cloud\!

**Nanaki**  
I'm glad you're back with us\!

**Cait Sith**  
This's kinda on the spur o' the moment, but shouldn't we oughta get to Junon\!?

**Vincent**  
Escape from a world of illusions... Hmph... I wonder which is better...?

**Cid**  
I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one.  
I always forget who has what materia.

**Crew Members**  
Ahhhhh\! Oh no, oh no, oh no\!  
Sorry, I'm in the middle of a very delicate operation\!

**Yuffie**  
Huh?  
How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is... getting sick on boats and rides......  
So, please...... just leave me alone.

**Cloud**  
......I really do understand, Yuffie. When I get sick on a flight, it's a real killer.  
When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion sickness.

**Yuffie**  
Oh......  
Isn't there any way to prevent this?

**Cloud**  
Well, according to my research......  
First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick.  
But you can't always be nervous.  
With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding.  
It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.  
But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks.  
That sucked\!......  
And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding.  
And that is......  
Read\!  
Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do.  
I know it's tough......

**Yuffie**  
......so you're a little better off than me.  
But I don't feel...... well.  
Where's the next stop? Can't you get there any quicker?  
Cloud, put me in your party, so I can get off this ship.

**Crew Member**  
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here\!  
Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you using Chocobos?  
I mean, just loading them up and transporting them.

If you have a chocobo on board...

**Crew Member in Chocobo Stable**  
That's a good Chocobo.

**Learner Pilot (L8)**  
Wanna Go?

**Cloud**  
\- Yes  
\- No

---

<span id="aftermath"></span>Going back to Mideel in ruins...

**Old Man at Entrance**  
Ahoy\! This here's Mideel. As you can see, this used to be a quiet hot springs town.  
Everything's gone now but in a way, I'm kinda glad everything's cleaned out. Feels better this way, ho, ho.

**Bald Man**  
Hey, you feelin' all better now? That's good, real good.  
Now don't overdo yourself like that again, hear?

He turns to survey the ruins of the town.

But isn't the Lifestream a strange thing?  
When I die, I wonder if I'll flow along in the middle of a warm gentle stream like this......?

**Shopper**  
Hee, hee. Welcome. It's here. The day's finally come\! Your day to shop\!\!  
Do we have items and weapons\!? Well, I should say so. And here's a bargain\! What would you say to 50% off everything?  
Just kidding. Even I wouldn't do something like that. Now what can I do for you today?  
Thank you. Come again\!

**Doctor**  
Hmphf? You...\!? How did you recover from your Mako poisoning?  
This is absolutely amazing...... I am so glad for you\! Looks like your friends' wishes came true.  
You can see for yourself what things look like, but at least no one was seriously hurt. We're just very unhappy now.

**Nurse**  
You probably don't remember, but you know that girl that watched over you for so long when you were sick?  
You'd better take care of her. If you don't, you'll be sorry. Believe you me\!  
Well anyhow...... Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?

Cloud and the others rest.

OK\! Perfect\! Well then, take care.

**Item Shopkeeper**  
Welcome\! We always welcome cash\! What can I do for you today?  
I'm sorry. Our stock isn't so great now... But that's just the way it is here.  
If you're looking for other items, why don't you check out the other stores?

**Girl in Blue**  
Have you seen my husband? He disappeared during the big earthquake and I haven't seen him since.  
I thought he'd be in the store......  
You don't think he got through that door and went to another country on the other side, do you?  
That's all just a dream...... Nothing like that could ever really happen. Heh...

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
Welcome. Just what you need at time like this--a shop of rest and relaxation. What you want?  
Thank you\! We don't have many goods but you coming again, please.

**Girl**  
Oh great. Now I've got to find another job......  
I guess I might as well make my side job as an accessory seller into my regular job.  
Well, since you're already here, why don't you buy something to take back with you?  
Thank you. Stop by again.

<span id="lower"></span>Cloud and the others arrive at lower Junon.

**Woman**  
They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.  
Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.  
I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the off-shore Underwater Reactor.  
Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?

**Older Man**  
I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.  
The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe.  
You should be able to get to the reactor through it.

**Priscilla**  
Who are you---?  
Cloud\!\!  
Stupid jerk\! Look how much you made me worry\!\! Were you at the Lifestream?

**Cloud**  
Yeah, that's right.

**Priscilla**  
You've gotta be more careful\! Because you're going to marry me one day.

Cloud takes the elevator to Upper Junon.

**Soldier on the Path to the Airport**  
The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Undersea Reactor\!  
When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.  
Get out of here before you get in the way\!  
What... me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either\!

Cloud runs outside to the airport.

**Soldier**  
After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down\!

**Soldier 2**  
They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.

Cloud leaves the base and starts down the street, then stops and turns to his companions. Behind them, the Junon cannon is no longer visible.

**Cloud**  
I may be mistaken, but...... Doesn't it feel like we're missing something?

<span id="reactor"></span>Cloud and the others continue on. On the path to the reactor, they come across a commander drilling his soldiers.

**Commander**  
All right\!\! Let's see how hard you trained\!  
Attention\! Charge--\!\!

The soldiers all charge in the opposite direction.

**Commander**  
He... hey--\!\! That's the Underwater Reactor\!\! Come back\!\!

The commander runs after them. At the end of the path, Cloud gets on an elevator with two soldiers and a redhead.

**Soldier**  
How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?

**Soldier 2**  
All right, you're on\!\!  
But... What if both of us...

**Soldier**  
Whoa\!\! Don't even talk about that\!

Cloud defeats both of them.

**Redhead**  
...gulp... (Great... there went two perfectly good men\!)

The elevator reaches the lower floor, and another pair of soldiers appears outside it to fight them.

**Soldier 3**  
OK\! Back to work\!\! Back to work\!\!

**Soldier 4**  
Yawn... I'm sleepy\!\!

**Soldier 3**  
For Junon\!\!

Cloud and the others continue on, go down another elevator, and pass through the underwater pipe to the reactor. They cross a catwalk above the submarine dock and fight their way through the reactor.

**Soldiers in Reactor**  
You, you're Cloud\!\!  
You are NOT getting this Huge Materia\!\!  
So you WERE after the Huge Materia\!

Cloud and the others reach where the Huge Materia is stored.

**Cloud**  
\!? The Huge Materia\!

They watch as a machine arm reaches down and removes the Huge Materia.

> **Barret**  
> Damn, just missed it\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> They're gonna take it on that submarine\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> If we take a short cut, we might just make it......\!

> Hey\! A Crane Game\!

> There's the submarine dock just ahead of us.
>
> **Vincent**  
> We were a little late...
>
> **Cid**  
> That's what you think\! ^%$@\#&$\#\!

They run to the submarine dock. Reno is standing with his back to them, supervising.

**Cloud**  
Did we make it\!?

He watches as the Huge Materia is lowered into the red submarine.

**Reno**  
What are you doing? Help load.

He turns around.

Cloud\!?

> **Barret**  
> We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia... Reno\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Looks like we barely made it.
>
> **Nanaki**

> **Yuffie**  
> I'm SURE\! You want me to do manual labor?
>
> **Vincent**  
> I refuse...
>
> **Cid**  
> You know I don't work for cheap\!

**Cloud**  
Either give it to us or else.  
...which is it gonna be?

**Reno**  
Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.  
My priority is the Huge Materia\!

He runs off, leaving Cloud and the others to fight the Carry Armor roboguard. After the battle, they find the red sub has already left.

**Cloud**  
Damn\! The submarine\!

> **Barret**  
> Damn\! So they was just buyin' time\!?

> **Tifa**  
> We have to go after it\!

> **Nanaki**

> **Cait Sith**  
> Oh no\! It left the dock...
>
> **Vincent**  
> There is one way...
>
> **Cid**  
> Hold on to your horses\! Let's get it from them\!\!

If Cloud tries to leave the submarine dock instead...

> **Barret**  
> We ain't jes' gonna let them take the Huge Materia, are we?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Cloud--\! We have to go after Rude\!
>
> **Nanaki**

>
> **Yuffie**

>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hey you\! Where ya goin'?
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey, hey, hey\! Where do you think you're goin'?

<span id="submarine"></span>They run for the other submarine, and the soldiers just outside it turn frantic.

**Soldiers**  
Y, you...\!  
You're not taking over this ship\!

They defeat the soldiers and board the submarine.

**Soldiers**  
You want the Sub? Just try an' take it\!  
Um... sir\! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off...

They fight off these soldiers, too.

**Barret**  
Come on, Cloud\! Follow me\!  
Damn, man\!\! ......what the...?  
Hey yo\! Remember I was the leader first, man\!  
Yo\! We come a long ways since we got on that train\!  
Lotsa things changed\! This and that.

They enter the bridge.

**Captain**  
NO, NO\!\! This is terrible\!

**Soldiers**  
We don't have much time left\! I don't want to die\!  
There's still so much more I've got to do\!  
I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle\!

**Captain**  
All right\!\! Then make this your first victory\!\!  
Go on, show 'em\!\!

**Soldiers**  
Yes, sir\!\!

**Captain**  
Remember your last training. Begin\!\!

**Soldiers**  
Yes, sir\!\!

**Captain**  
I'm back\! An' now I got no regrets\!\!  
ATT----ACK\!\!

**Cloud**  
Hmmmm...  
\- Fight them  
\- Take them prisoner

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fight them</span>

**Captain**  
Let me show you how it's done.

**Soldier**  
Eyaaarrrgh\!  
Captain... I can't hold on any longer\!  
Eyaaarrrgh\!

**Captain**  
Uggh... They got me.

**Soldier 2**  
The Special Pose...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Take them prisoner</span>

The soldiers move aside to let Cloud and the others into the control room.

</div>

Cloud crouches down, wringing his hands. Yuffie doesn't look any better off.

**Cloud**  
Someone... please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.  
The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine...

> **Barret**  
> Stop your blubberin'\!\! How we gonna move this without you?

> **Tifa**  
> What are we going to do... We stole a submarine but can't pilot it.

> **Vincent**  
> Better hurry. Reno's getting away.

> **Cid**

One of the others goes up to the control panel and presses a button.

> **Barret**  
> Arrrrrrrgh\!\!  
> EY\!\! Looks likes we're almost on our way\! Just keep on fiddlin' with it\!\!  
> It's all up to you\!

> **Tifa**

> I'm not very mechanical, but it seems like we're starting to move.  
> Hang in there.
>
> **Cid**  
> Hunka junk... just gotta do this\!  
> SEE\! Now you take over\!

Cloud gets up.

**Cloud**  
Hey, you're right... I DO feel a little better driving.  
No sweat. Just leave everything to me.

> **Barret**

**Soldiers**  
I thank you\! I am happy to be a hostage\!  
Piloting a submarine is very difficult\! I am completely clueless\!

**Captain**  
Hey\! Who am I to know\!

**Cloud**  
Well, now what?  
\- Read the manual  
\- Sit in the seat  
\- Leave it alone

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Read the manual</span>

**Submarine Operation Manual - Beginner's Edition**

A button controls reference is provided.

Mission Orders: Presently on the ocean floor near Junon, a Red Leader Submarine carrying Huge Materia is being escorted by covert Shinra Submarine Units.  
Furthermore, it has been confirmed that several mines have been dispersed onto the ocean floor.  
The ocean floor can only be monitored with Shinra's Sonar Radar Screen.  
Enemy subs can only be detected with the Sonar area. Get in front of the detected enemy sub and "Lock On"\!\!  
Push \[\] button to fire the torpedo\!  
The mines are found on the radar screen at the top of the indicators. The mines inflict great damage, so be careful\!  
Objective: Sink the Red Leader Submarine carrying the Huge Materia\! Time Limit: 10 minutes\!  
Advice  
1\. Get the enemy submarine in front of you\!  
2\. Concentrate attack on the Red Leader Submarine\!  
3\. If you lose track of the enemy, push the R1 button and use your radar\!

**Submarine Operation Manual - Intermediate's Edition**  
Radar Screen: The mines are found at the top of the indicators on the screen.  
The basic strategies are to 1) avoid the indicators, and 2) "Lock On" to enemies from behind.  
The lower gauge shows the sub's remaining power. The right gauge shows the sub's speed. Other warnings are as follows...  
WARNING... Enemy submarine detected nearby\!  
ALERT... Approaching torpedo detected\!  
MINE... Mine detected nearby\!  
CONFLICT... Collisison with the ocean floor\!

**Submarine Operation Manual - Advanced Edition**

A button controls reference is provided.

How to release the "Lock On" mode: If the sub leaves the center of the sonar screen, the "Lock On" mode will reset.  
When Locked On by an enemy torpedo: Shift up to maximum speed by pressing \[triangle\] button repeatedly.  
This will enable you to speed up past the maximum speed and outrun the torpedo\! ...That is all.

Cloud sits down.

**Cloud**  
Everything seems set...

Once Cloud starts the mission:

**Cloud**  
Phew--\! We did it\!\!  
The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's continue the search...

**Cloud**  
Hear that? Junon Airport\!  
We can still get the Huge Materia back\! Let's hurry\!

They hurry from the control room.

**Cloud**  
We're breakin' out of here\!

We're gonna hop on a torpedo and blast outta here\!  
Don't worry\! I won't miss\!  
We don't even have a target. We're just aiming for the sky.

Fade to black as they run towards the torpedo bay. Cloud comes to on the Junon beach with an old man nearby and Mr. Dolphin splashing him with its tail. The old man runs back into the village, and Cloud sits up.

**Cloud**  
Old man...

**Cloud**  
Let's go...

The party can now return to the Underwater Reactor, but taking the earlier path through the underwater pipe leads to a locked door. Instead, Cloud talks to a pair of soldiers guarding a door near the entrance with a dog.

**Soldiers**  
This is the Junon Submarine Dock\!  
If you want to enter, please talk to my dog.  
That's all the instructions you're going to get\! Let's go\!\!

Cloud and the others fight and defeat the soldiers, but the dog remains.

**Cloud**  
Damn, Shinra dogs\!\!  
We'll take that submarine\!\! Out of our way\!\!

The dog runs through the door, and Cloud gives chase out onto a submarine dock.

**Cloud**  
Shinra dog...\!\!  
\- Ignore it  
\- Dognap it\!

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Ignore it</span>

**Cloud**  
Feelin' lonely\!? You'd better get back to your master.

The dog whimpers and runs away.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Dognap it\!</span>

**Cloud**  
Shinra dog\!\! I'm gonna dognap you\!\!

The dog whimpers and runs onto the submarine.

**Cloud**  
Those attackers won't bother us now.

</div>

Cloud and the others board the submarine.

**Soldier**  
P... Please\!\! Spare me\!\!

**Cloud**  
Hmm......  
\- Take them all hostage  
\- Fight them

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Take them all hostage</span>

**Cloud**  
Be grateful. I'm taking you prisoner.

**Soldiers**  
You're pretty nice\!  
Thank you\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Fight them</span>

**Cloud**  
Don't think we're weak.

</div>

If you try to leave the submarine...

**Cloud**  
We can't go back after coming this far.

If the dog came aboard, it will be waiting outside the bridge. Cloud continues to the bridge to find the captain and two more soldiers.

**Cloud**  
An unconditional surrender, huh?  
\- I'm your prisoner  
\- Don't bet on it...

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">I'm your prisoner</span>

The soldiers nod and step aside.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't bet on it...</span>

Cloud and the others fight the soldiers.

**Captain**  
Let me show you how it's done.

**Soldier**  
Captain... I can't hold on any longer\!  
Eyaaarrrgh\!

**Captain**  
Uggh... They got me.

**Soldier 2**  
The Special Pose...

</div>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received "Shinra Sub"\!

</div>

Cloud hops into the driver's seat.

**Cloud**  
We'll hide it somewhere secluded.

</div>

<span id="junon"></span>They return to the surface and dock the submarine outside Junon. They hurry back to Junon.

**Fisherman**  
It seems like there's something going on again up there.  
Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar?

**Older Man**  
I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.  
They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above.

They take the elevator to Upper Junon.

**Soldier on the Path to the Airport**  
Finished loading the Huge Materia\!  
All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, 'Gelnika', for departure and we're done\!

Cloud arrives at the airport only to watch the Gelnika take off from Junon.

**Cloud**  
Oh no\! The Huge Materia...

> **Barret**  
> Let's go after it\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Can't we go after it?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Let's get there before they do and catch 'em\!

> **Cait Sith**  
> How 'bout us getting there beforehand and stealing it back?
>
> **Vincent**  
> Let's go after it.
>
> **Cid**  
> Grrrrgh\! Just barely\! We're goin' after it\!

> **Barret**

> **Nanaki**

>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Where is it flying to?
>
> **Vincent**  
> Where is their destination...?
>
> **Cid**  
> Where's that thing headed?

**Cloud**  
Rocket Town, of course.

**Soldier**  
Whew... I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete.

**Soldier 2**  
Not so fast. We still have one major task... we still have to transport the stuff...

**Soldier**  
The stuff...

**Soldier on the Path to the Airport**  
I'm glad we got Gelnika to the Rocket Town safely.  
But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia's to break up Meteor...

Cloud and the others leave Junon.

If they successfully shot down the red leader sub, they can now search the ocean floor for it.

**Cloud**  
So this is the Leader Sub...  
Damn...... makes me sick just thinking about it...

<div class="highlight">

...Huge Materia recovered...  
...no damage appears to have been sustained...

</div>

**Cloud**  
...Phew... That's good to hear.

<div class="highlight">

Received Key Item "Huge Materia"\!

<span id="gelnika"></span>They may also come across the sunken Gelnika. Cloud and the others board it.

**Cloud**  
This is the Shinra's Gelnika type airplane... I wonder why it went down here?

They enter a side room.

**Cloud**  
What is this place...? Must be some kind of a Research Establishment because there's a Mako generator?

In the hallway, they encounter Reno and Rude.

**Cloud**  
Turks\!?

**Rude**  
...again?

**Reno**  
We just seem to keep running into each other lately\!  
There were weapons and Materia developed solely to destroy Sephiroth.

**Rude**  
...but, it was attacked by Weapon and sunk to the bottom of the sea.

**Reno**  
I can't give you what's here. We'll take out Sephiroth.  
I guess this is our last meeting.

**Rude**  
I won't let you get in our way.

Cloud and the others fight the Turks.

**Reno**  
These guys are pretty tough.

He runs off.

**Rude**  
..................

He runs off after Reno.

**Cloud**  
So Shinra's new, secret weapon was on this Airship...

They enter the room beyond.

**Cloud**  
This must be the Cargo Room...  
This is terrible... It's all messed up...

Cloud and the others salvage what they can from the cargo room and return to the submarine.

If they continue exploring the ocean floor, it is possible to find the Key to Ancients before it becomes plot relevant.

**Cloud**  
It looks like a key to somewhere...  
It seems really old.

<div class="highlight">

...analysis completed...  
...exact date of origin cannot be determined...  
...estimated to be several thousand years...

**Cloud**  
Several thousand years... ...Ancients?

<span id="highwind"></span>Back on the Highwind...

**Barret**  
Them Shinra guys think they're gonna fight Meteor with the Huge Materia?

**Tifa**  
How are you feeling?  
You ought to rest a bit... Don't push yourself.

**Nanaki**  
Shinra only cares if things are good right now.  
But, I plan to live for 500 years and won't stand for that type of thinking.

**Cait Sith**  
Them Shinra's ar' all gathered at Cid's Rocket Town...  
Yep... there ain't nuthin' I like more than lettin' out secrets.

**Vincent**  
...how does it feel, Cloud? Living for yourself and not someone else?

**Cid**  
You said there's somethin' goin' on at Rocket Town...?

**Yuffie**  
Hmph\!......  
I wonder why anyone would ever make an airship like this......  
Ugh...... ugh......

**Learner Pilot (L9)**  
Wanna go?

Cloud and the others arrive at Rocket Town.

Inside the inn...

**Barkeeper**  
Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore the rocket...

**Man**  
Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank\!?

Back outside...

**Mechanic**  
What's young president Rufus doing by getting all those mechanics together?

**Redhead**  
The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? But why now...?

**Old Man**  
There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket...  
Is my rocket... all right?

Inside the house on the right, if Cid is in the party...

**Old Man**  
Hey Cid\! I just thought of the best joke\! Listen to this one.

**Cid**  
I'm so sick of hearing these dumb puns, but okay... let's get it over with. Go on... let me hear it.

**Old Man**  
Uh, now, let's see, how did it go...  
...He's crude an' a jerk...  
I mean, He's Rude of the Turks\!

**Cloud**  
......??

**Cid**  
And?

**Old Man**  
President Rufus, lathers Tantrics...  
Uh, I mean... President Rufus, gathers mechanics...  
Raunchy meat, a pocket full, at the cafeteria. Uh, I mean... Launch a beat up rocket full of Materia.

**Barret, Tifa, Nanaki, Yuffie, Cait Sith, or Vincent**  
(A fearful sense of humor...)

**Cloud**  
(The problem starts way before his sense of humor.)

**Cid**  
...I thought it might be fun to hear some of your stupid puns again for old times sake... my mistake.

**Old Man**  
Oh, 'crap-again' (oh, captain).

Cid kicks him, and the old man falls over.

**Cid**  
Dammit\! That does it\!

**Old Man**  
How rude...

**Cid**  
Rude, hell\! You're the one who always cracks those \#$\#\#@& jokes\!

He turns back to Cloud.

Sorry, 'bout that, now lesse...  
Looks like that \*&%$\#^$ Rufus wants to use my rocket for somethin'.  
Let's go to the launching pad\!

**Old Man** (lying on the floor)  
Ugh... Nice kick.

\* **Note**: These "puns" are also extremely terrible in the Japanese. Rather than translate the meaning, the English script attempts to reproduce the approximate level of "this word sounds vaguely like this other word," although the pocket meat joke manages to be similar. How we got to "lathers Tantrics" though is anyone's guess.

<span id="arrival"></span>Cloud heads for the rocket. Below, a couple stands watching.

**Man**  
Mmmmm, a SPECTACLE.

**Woman**  
Is something about to happen? Oh, I'm getting excited.

**Soldiers**  
Those terrorists are here\!

Cloud and the others fight off the first two soldiers and run up the stairs.

**Commander**  
Don't let them get any further\! Everyone, ATTACK---\!

They fight off a second set of soldiers.

**Commander**  
Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere\! Uh un, nowhere\!

They fight off the last of the soldiers outside of the rocket.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cid is not in the party...</span>

Cid runs up the steps to join Cloud.

**Cid**  
Wait, Cloud\!  
If you're gonna kick those \*\#$% Shinra out of my rocket, then take me with you\!  
ALL RIGHT\! Let's show those &$\!@& Shinra\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cid is in the party...</span>

**Cid**  
Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my rocket\!?  
I'm outta here, Cloud\! I'm gonna kick those $^%$\# Shinra right out of my rocket\!

</div>

If Cloud attempts to leave the launchpad...

**Cid**  
Cloud, what are you doin'\!? There gonna launch the rocket\!\!

The couple still stands watching below.

**Man**  
Mmmm, here comes some hard action\!

**Woman**  
What? You guys are terrorists? Wow, that's kinda exciting\!

They continue up the ladder to the rocket and encounter Rude of the Turks.

**Rude**  
...you again?  
...We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way.

They fight and defeat Rude, who collapses on the walkway.

**Rude**  
Ugh......... gh.........  
......they got us.  
...hmm.

Cloud and the others enter the rocket.

**Commander**  
You... you\! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been here\!\!

**Cloud**  
Too bad. Those guys are over there.

**Commander**  
Oh man... the Turks, being done in like that... But, I won't let you through\!

They fight off the commander.

**Commander**  
urrrrgh...

They continue into the cockpit, where Cid's old crew is preparing for the launch.

**Cid**  
Hey\! What the hell're you guys doin'\!?

**Mechanic 1**  
Hey\! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you come back\!

**Mechanic 3**  
Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket\!

**Cid**  
Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?

**Mechanic 2**  
We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor.

**Mechanic 1**  
Our rocket's gonna save the planet\!

**Mechanic 2**  
Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL\!\!

**Cloud**  
Wait a minute\!

**Cid**  
Shut up\!\! Just shut the hell up\!

He turns back to his crew.

How's the rocket?

Cloud turns to the other party member and shrugs.

**Mechanic 1**  
It's pretty much OK.

**Mechanic 2**  
But...

**Mechanic 3**  
We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most important device is broken.

**Cid**  
Broken? How's the repair goin'?

**Mechanic 3**  
Shera's doin' it...

**Cid**  
Oh great\! What a buncha wizards you guys are\! She's gonna take a 100 years\!  
I'll take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot\!  
Hey, go ahead\! Go tell everyone\!

<span id="launch"></span>**Mechanics**  
All right, Captain. Good luck.

They all run out.

**Cloud**  
Hey, Cid\! What're you doing\!?  
There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the Materia.  
We're gonna borrow their powers and save the planet from Sephiroth.  
There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You understand that, right?

**Cid**  
Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I also understand what you're thinking.  
But listen.  
I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.  
No, I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the power of science.  
Humans who used to only roam around on the ground are able to fly now\!  
And finally, we're about to go into outer space.  
Science is a "Power" created and developed by humans. And science just might be what saves this planet.  
I was able to earn my living thanks to science. So to me, there's nothing greater\!  
Now quit your worrying 'bout what Shinra's gonna do\!  
I don't want to regret not having done something later.

**Cloud**  
But, Cid......

**Cid**  
Shut the hell up\!\! I don't wanna hear it\!\!  
Alright, time to get to work\! Anyone who ain't involved, get the hell outta here\!

The rocket starts shaking.

**Cid**  
What the hell......? What the hell happened\!?

<div class="highlight">

**Palmer** (over the intercom)  
Hey-hey\!

</div>

**Cid**  
Palmer\! What the hell did'ya do\!?

<div class="highlight">

**Palmer**  
They said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I laun---ched it\!

</div>

**Cid**  
Goddamn Shera\! Why'd she pick today to get fast\!

He runs to the control panel.

DAMN\! Won't even budge\! It's completely locked up\!

<div class="highlight">

**Palmer**  
Hey-hey-hey\! Almost lift off\!

</div>

**Cid**  
What the\!? No countdown\!? It just don't seem the same without it\!

<div class="highlight">

**Palmer**  
Hey\!\!\!\! Hey-hey\!\!\! Blast-----off\!

</div>

The rocket blasts off from the launch pad and into space.

**Cid**  
I finally made it... outer space...  
Let's see, how's the course set...?  
Yup, it's headed for a collision with Meteor.

> **Barret**  
> Can't we do somethin'? We can't jus' leave it.

> **Vincent**  
> We're in space now. A long rest...

**Cid**  
That damn Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. We might not be able to change the course.

**Cloud**  
...this is the end?

**Cid**  
Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, and you give up that easily?  
I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.  
Just watch.  
I keep an Escape Pod on the rocket just for emergencies like this.  
I deciphered the lock code on the Escape Pod. We'll bail right before we crash into Meteor.

**Cid**  
......  
If you want the Materia, do whatever you want\!  
The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder.

**Cloud**  
...You sure?

**Cid**  
I dunno...  
I know what I said a minute ago.  
But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer space.  
So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?

If Cloud moves to leave the cockpit without getting the Huge Materia...

**Cid**  
Hey, Cloud.  
If you're goin' to get the Materia, it's this way.

<span id="materia"></span>Cloud has the option of climbing the ladder to where the Huge Materia is kept.

**Cloud**  
I finally found the Huge Materia...

**Cid**  
It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the passcode from this control panel.  
Hey Cloud, you know how to use it, right?  
Everytime it says, 'Enter Passcode,' push one of those O X △ ◻ buttons.  
If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get the Huge Materia\!

**Cloud**  
So, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in?

**Cid**  
I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud inputs the correct code on the first try...</span>

<div class="highlight-nopad">

**Cid**  
Whoa, pretty good\! You got the passcode in a single try\!  
You must've known the passcode. If not, it's impossible.

**Cid**  
Seems like you missed the code\!  
If we don't enter the correct passcode before the Protection System activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back\!  
I heard there's a passcode only the top people in Shinra know.  
We probably have to enter that. Try and enter some codes while I try and remember that passcode\!  
I think the first digit wasn't a ◻.  
I think the second digit wasn't an X...  
The second digit wasn't a △. I'm sure of it\!  
The third digit was an X ......I think.  
I'm pretty sure that the last digit was a △. No, maybe it was an X...?  
I have a feeling you push the O only once...  
Did you use the △? I'm pretty sure you didn't...  
I think there was a key that you have to push twice...  
Hmmmmmm, I can't remember. Give me some more time\!

<span id="escape"></span>Cloud and the others make for the escape pod. As they pass through the engine room, one of the oxygen tanks explodes.

**Cid**  
Grrrgh\!  
Damn\! My leg's stuck in the debris......

Cid\!\!

Cloud and the other party member move to lift the debris.

**Cid**  
Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go\! If you don't hurry, the rocket's gonna crash into Meteor\!

**Cloud**  
...I can't go without my friends.

**Cid**  
You ^%\#@&%......\! No time to worry 'bout other people\!

**Cloud**  
I'm gonna do whatever I can.

**Cid**  
You're stupid. You're really $\#&^%$\* stupid.  
Tank Number 8 blew up...... So Tank Number 8... really was malfunctioning......  
Shera... You were right.  
But, ......this is the end for me.

The door opens.

**Shera**  
Don't say that, Cid.

**Cid**  
Huh\!? Shera\!?

**Shera**  
I tagged along. I'm coming to help you.

She moves to help Cloud pull.

**Cid**  
You stupid &$\#&%\*%&%\#\!\!  
......Sorry.

With Shera's help, they manage to free Cid, and she leads them towards the escape pod.

**Shera**  
The Escape Pod is this way. Please hurry.

They follow Shera to the pod.

**Shera**  
Hurry. I'm going to detach the Escape Pod.

**Cid**  
Hey, Shera\! Does this Pod really fly?

**Shera**  
It'll be OK. I've been checking it till now.

**Cid**  
.........Then I'm relieved.

**Shera**  
......Thanks.

They detach in the escape pod.

**Cid** (plastered to the window)  
So this is...... outer space...  
Man... it's the real thing... I'm really here in outer space...  
So long, Shinra No. 26...

The rocket goes on to crash into Meteor. People watch from all over the world. The explosion is blinding, but afterwards, Meteor remains, barely harmed at all. The people watching from Midgar react with despair.

<span id="highwind"></span>Back on the Highwind...

**Cloud**  
Rufus and the others plan was a failure...

**Barret**  
What a bust... But I kinda hoped it'd work.

**Cait Sith**  
We been botherin' them as much as we can...  
But there ain't no other way... Wonder if we've been wrong all this time?

**Nanaki**  
Makes you worry, doesn't it?

**Tifa**  
Don't worry\! Think\!

**Cid**  
Hey\! The girl's right.  
You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it\! Things just start fallin' apart and get worse and worse.

**Barret**  
You're pretty damn optimistic\! You up to somethin'?

**Cid**  
Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that.  
All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet.  
I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that escape pod.

**Cloud**  
I've... been thinking too. About the universe... planet... ocean.  
How wide and big... No matter where I go and what I do it won't change a thing.

**Cid**  
Maybe you're right.  
But I came up with something different.  
I always thought this planet was so huge.  
But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.  
We're just floatin' in the dark. ......kind of makes you feel powerless.  
On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a sickness.  
That's why I say this planet's still a kid.  
A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge universe.  
Someone's gotta protect it.  
Ya follow me? That someone is us.

**Tifa**  
Cid... that's beautiful.

**Barret**  
Yo\! Cid\! You even got to me\!  
Do, now what? How're we gonna protect the planet from Meteor?

Cid scratches his head and sits down.

**Cid**  
...............I'm still thinkin' about that.

The others shake their heads and disperse.

**Nanaki**  
Huh\!?  
Did you...... hear something?

They hear the Planet's screaming.

**Tifa**  
The planet's scream...... or Meteor...? Is it this planet?

**Cloud**  
Hey, how do we know that this is really the planet's scream?

**Tifa**  
Did you forget?  
Bugenhagen told us.

**Cloud**  
Bugenhagen...

**Nanaki**  
Let's go see Grandfather\! To Cosmo Canyon\!  
I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful\!

**Barret**  
That Bugenhagen guy... He was a weird old dude.  
I thought he was some kinda naturalist, but he was all into them machines.

**Tifa**  
Did Bugenhagen...... tell you anything?

**Nanaki**  
Hurry, hurry\! We must go meet Grandfather\!

**Cait Sith**  
This's just between you 'n' me but...  
That there Bugenhagen feller, used to be a pretty handy Shinra worker.  
Yep, he ain't never bought no weapons or Mako though......

**Vincent**  
The machines in Cosmo Canyon were presents of Dr. Gast.  
Wrapped up in the planet's strange notions surrounded by Shinra-made machines...  
Science and the planet lived side by side in that old man's heart.

**Cid**  
Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me knowin' it?  
All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me.

**Yuffie**  
What? Are we there?  
I know it's all for Wutai, But I can't take much more of this.

**Learner Pilot (L10)**  
Shall we go?

**Cloud**  
\- Let's  
\- No, let's not

<span id="aftermath"></span>On returning to Rocket Town afterwards...

Inside the inn...

**Barkeeper**  
Even though they failed to blow up Meteor with the rocket, the Shinra haven't given up yet...  
Looks like they're gathering all the weapons from all their bases and are preparing for a final showdown.

**Man**  
OK, which is it gonna be? Meteor hits us first, or that guy comes out of the bathroom?  
I'm not movin' from this spot till I see it with my own eyes.

Inside a house...

**Man**  
Even the rocket launch wasn't all THAT great.

**Woman**  
Now that one of Shinra's greatest events is over, I guess it's back to the same old boring everyday life again...

In the Item Shop...

**Woman**  
Is Gramps gonna stay like that even though rocket's gone?

Back outside...

**Old Man**  
My, my precious rocket... It's gone.  
Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone.  
But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will.  
Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.  
But, out of appreciation, let me give you this.

<div class="highlight">

Received "Venus Gospel"\!

</div>

**Old Man**  
I wish you'd take care of it and use it...  
Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby...  
Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at Cid's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing...

**Redhead**  
I get so restless now that the rocket's gone. And now that we can see Meteor clearly, ...I can't stand it.

**Mechanic**  
I still can't believe that piece of crap rocket actually made it into space... I guess the mechanic was a genius.

Inside the house on the right, if you heard the old man's joke earlier...

**Old Man**  
I got to learn more... Devotion, devotion.

Cid's house...

**Shera**  
Now all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able...  
Excuse me... ...Please take care of the Captain.

<span id="sector5"></span>If Cloud returns to Midgar, there is a person standing outside the gate to Sector 5.

**Person**  
That's funny... did I drop the key to this gate... somewhere? Was it when I was on that excavation tour?

Cloud can dig for and obtain the key up in Bone Village. He can then return and enter Sector 5. In Aeris's church, two kids stand near the flower bed...

**Boy**  
They're purty\!

**Girl**  
Hey\! Where's the flower lady?

Elsewhere in Sector 5...

**Person Outside the Pipe**  
These folks went wobbling off somewhere...  
They said something about the 'Reunion starting'... sounded almost like a chant. Wonder what the heck that meant.

**Woman Walking Around**  
I'm not going to look up or down\! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead.  
Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.

**Person in Blue**  
What's going on with the world? When it's all said and done, we're all gonna wind up dead.

**Man in Straw Hat**  
Yeah, that's right\! But, even so, where could we move to now...?

**Person in Blue**  
...You've been talking like that for sometime now.

**Materia Shopkeeper**  
And I just got together enough money to get out of this place...  
Now it doesn't matter where I go\! Ho, ho, ho...

**Item Shopkeeper**  
...stare... ......hmph... we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.

**Weapons Shopkeeper**  
I don't know crap about crap\! But I do know one thing.  
The one thing that you'll always need is a good strong weapon\!

Inside a house...

**TV**  
......ga...... g, ga ga..............

**Kid**  
SOLDIER? What about them\!?  
Damn\! If they really were from SOLDIER, they would be doing something about all this\!\!

**Man Upstairs**  
The trick to bein' a real man, is not to fart around, but to let everyone know where you stand, right off\!

<span id="sector6"></span>Sector 6, Wall Market. A soldier stands guard outside the Honey Bee Inn...

**Soldier**  
Heee, ...... The Shinra have occupied this shop\!

Inside the automated item store, if Cid and Tifa are in the party...

**Cid**  
Hmm? Let me see that.

He messes with the machine, then turns to Tifa.

It should work now. Go on, try and use it now.

Tifa presses a button on the machine, and a bright light flashes red.

**Tifa**  
Cid\! What did you do\!?

**Cid**  
Don't get mad, you'll just get more wrinkles. Hey, something's comin' out.

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Elsewhere...

**Cat Kid**  
I wish I could live with a real cat.

**Punk**  
We're not leavin' this city no matter what happens.

**Man Outside Restaurant**  
It's a weird world we live in, so eat up and work hard.

**Man Cooking Outside**  
I don't know what's gonna happen next, But first, you gatta fill your stomach.

**Man Outside Dress Shop**  
Seems like everything has frills on it.

Inside the gym...

**Man Using Punching Bag**  
These days, you've got to have strength. Come on, you should work out.

In the Weapons Shop...

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
Oh, so you're back? I got something good for you. Why don't you buy it?

**Cloud**  
You probably just found it lying around somewhere, right?

**Weapons Shop Owner**  
I'll admit that I found it, but you may never be able to get another one like it again.  
How 'bout 129,000 Gil for it?

**Cloud**  
...What kind of price is that?  
\- Oh, all right... I'll buy it  
\- No, I don't want it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Oh, all right... I'll buy it</span>

**Weapons Shop Owner**

<span id="kalm"></span>At Kalm...

**Redhead**  
Listen to me\! Something really big's happening in Midgar.  
They were just saying on TV it was Rufus second strategy and...  
That big cannon's pointed due north...... You think the target's...... Sephiroth?

**Man**  
Sephiroth put up a huge barrier around the North Crater.  
Rufus wants to use a mammoth cannon to smash the barrier.  
He plans to have Shinra troops rush in and attack Sephiroth after the barrier falls.

Inside the second house...

**Old Man**  
Everyone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming.  
I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, got attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea......

---

<span id="junon"></span>At Lower Junon...

**Woman**  
I heard a war's about to start\! And that's why they're moving the big cannon\!

**Older Man**  
Listen Cloud, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child.  
Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor?

In Upper Junon...

**Soldier**  
The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.  
What... me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.

**Soldier Guarding the Respectable Inn**  
Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all\!?  
All right\! You can enter\!\!

<span id="costa"></span>At Costa del Sol...

Johnny's House...

**Johnny**  
No, no, NO\!\! Meteor's getting bigger by the minute\!\!  
I wanna live on the edge right now\! I want to build a home with my woman and grow old together\!  
If you can't do it, I will\! And that's that\!  
I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there, too\!

<span id="corel"></span>At North Corel...

**Man in Hardhat**  
Hey, the Gold Saucer reopened\!  
We've got to play hard to get our minds of Meteor.

At the ropeway station...

**Redhead**  
I'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits\!

**Blond**  
I know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then?

**Station Man**  
The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?

---

<span id="gold"></span>At Gold Saucer...

**Dio** (if you spoke to him while it was closed)  
I thought about it, but there was only one conclusion.  
I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this.  
Enjoy yourselves... Ha ha ha ha...

Occasionally, a man will appear standing by the house in back of the ropeway.

**Man**  
Hey, how 'bout it, change your gil into GP?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- Not interested

**Man**  
Hey, thanks 1 GP is 100 gil.  
Is x gil okay?

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- No

**Man**  
If you want some more later, I'll be around now and then.

He vanishes.

At Chocobo Square...

**Ester**  
Hey, long time no see... How have you been?  
There's a lot going on in the world outside.  
It got a little lonely around here, but you can't keep a jockey from doing what he loves.  
How 'bout it, you want to ride again? You have your own Chocobo, right?  
Do you want to ride?

**Cloud**  
\- Let me register  
\- Tell me how to ride it  
\- Don't do it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Let me register</span>

If you don't have any chocobos stabled...

**Ester**  
Hmm, seems like there aren't any Chocobos that can be registered...

Otherwise:

**Cloud**  
Which one?

Cloud selects a chocobo.

**Ester**  
I'll register this C/B/A/S rank Chocobo.

**Cloud**  
\- Yeah  
\- I changed my mind, don't do it

**Ester**  
Which do you want, the long course or the short one?

**Cloud**  
\- Short  
\-Long

Occasionally, Tifa or Cid may interject here:

> **Tifa**  
> Hey, Cloud. Let me ride once in a while.

> **Cid**  
> Hey, Cloud. Let me hop on sometime.

**Ester**

On Cloud's first race:

Yeahh, But the jockeys can't buy tickets.  
If you win, you'll get an item ticket, so do your best\!

On all subsequent races:

Good Luck\! Take care\!

**Ester**  
Congratulations\! You came in first\!

After winning 3 races in C or B rank:

And your Chocobo moved up a rank.  
From the next race on, that Chocobo will be in B/A rank.

After winning 3 races in A rank:

Wow that's great.  
Looks like you don't have any rivals in the A rank anymore.  
But you know, there's a rank that's full of those Chocobos.  
Ahem\!\! From the next race on, that Chocobo is...  
S rank\! Joe's usually in that group, too. So good luck.

After a number of wins in S rank:

Amazing...  
It's the first time since Joe that any jockey has won so much in the S rank.  
Good job. Here's a little something from me\!

I lost...

</div>

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Tell me how to ride it</span>

**Ester**  
Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem\!  
First use the \[Select\] button to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.  
In other words, either you control the Chocobo or let it run on its own.  
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.  
You can't really help on this one.  
But, most of the Chocobos that I'll provide you with are mellow and you should be able to handle them.  
When you're riding, use the \[\] Button to Speed Up and the X Button to Slow Down.  
But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll lose its stamina really fast.  
And use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use the O Button to get a boost of speed.  
Of course your stamina runs out faster though.  
There are some bad tempered Chocobos that can't pace themselves and they'll lose their stamina pretty fast.  
For those kinds of Chocobos, you should set the controls on Manual and slow it down.  
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,  
Push the \[Start\] button to end the race.

At Ghost Square...

**Zombie**  
Welcome. No matter what happens in this world, The Ghost Hotel will always be in business.  
Uuuuuuuuuugh......  
For reservations, please step up to the counter.  
Uuuuuuuuuugh......

At Battle Square...

**Black-haired Man**  
Hmmm...  
What, you too? With the way things are in the world, It makes you wonder what we're doin' here?  
Well, it's a little late for me to run around now, so I do what I love, it works best for me.  
Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate.  
But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.'  
But, there's gotta be a way to measure this too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength.

**Man Practicing Kicks**  
I'll give that Meteor my ultra kick...... ...or...... maybe not.

**Registration Lady**  
Those two over there eloped, saying stuff like 'OUr last moments together---' I can't bear it.  
I don't have anyone like that in my life so, if something happens, it happens.  
...that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that...

If Cloud tries to enter the arena without registering...

**Registration Lady**  
Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You won't be able to go in through there until you come and register.

By this point, Cloud may be able to access the special duel at the Battle Arena.

**Registration Lady**  
You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong?  
Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?  
Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match......  
How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?

**Cloud**  
\- Let's do it  
\- Not interested

**Woman Outside Battle Square**

**Man Running after Kids**  
Now, be careful of Meteor.

**Staffer Offering Prize Exchanges**  
We got new prizes. But what's in them is a secret.

**First Person Playing Wonder Catcher**  
I can't stop, no matter what's happening outside...

**Second Person Playing Wonder Catcher**  
You sure are an unusual one. Staying here with all that's happening outside...... guess that makes, uh, two of us... huh?

**Fortune Telling Machine**  
Never give up.

Sometimes when playing the Snowboarding game, Cid or Tifa will speak up.

**Tifa**  
Hey, Cloud. Let me ride once in a while.

**Cid**  
Hey, Cloud. Let me hop on sometime.

**Cloud**  
\- Sure  
\- Nope

<span id="gongaga"></span>At Gongaga...

**Old Man**  
Shinra's tried a lot of things, but it's only HUMAN. It's fate that Meteor will kill the people.

**Redhead**  
...Everyone's going to die. Everything's coming to an end.

<span id="ancients"></span>Returning to the City of the Ancients and approaching the crystal in the viewing chamber...

**Cloud**  
...It's similar.  
This place... is similar to the inside of the Lifestream.  
...All the different noise.  
...The noise doesn't go through your ears, but directly into your head.  
It seems to mean something... but I can't quite get it. I hate not knowing what it is.  
That's what this is similar to.

**(any of the others)**  
Now that you mention it...

> **Barret**  
> My head feels like it's gettin' crushed.

> **Tifa**  
> My head feels like it's getting crushed.

> **Nanaki**  
> My head feels like it's getting crushed.

> **Vincent**  
> My head is about to be crushed.

> **Cid**  
> My head feels like it's gettin' crushed\!

**Cloud**  
So Aeris came here too... She stood in this exact spot...  
Hmm... Aeris didn't have to come here.  
She was able to find out all the information here.  
What Aeris needed was that altar... and only that.  
Aeris...... Aeris... What were you planning to do?  
What... are we supposed to do?

---

<span id="glacier"></span>In Great Glacier...

**Holzoff**  
It's dangerous past the cliff because of the Barrier\!  
It's better not to go anywhere near it\!\!  
Like to rest a little?

**Cloud**  
\- Oh yeah  
\- No, thanks

**Holzoff** (if Cloud declines)  
Don't over do it.

If Cloud attempts to go to the cliffs, Holzoff comes running out of his house.

**Holzoff**  
Look we can't go to the cliff\! So just give it up\!\!

### Lucrecia's Cave - Vincent's Past

---

While roaming the ocean in the submarine, Cloud and the others come across a deep lake beneath a waterfall. Behind the waterfall is a large cave with a glowing altar.

If Vincent is not in the party, Lucrecia's voice will randomly say one name or the other...

**Lucrecia**  
Sephiroth... | Vincent...

The altar is vacant, and Cloud turns to go.

**Lucrecia**  
Sephiroth... | Vincent...

Returning with Vincent in the party, Lucrecia will randomly say one name or the other...

**Lucrecia**  
Sephiroth... | Vincent...

**Vincent**  
That voice? It can't be...

He steps forward.

Lucrecia...?

Lucrecia is standing at the altar, and she turns on hearing his voice.

**Lucrecia**  
Vincent......?

**Vincent** (running towards her)  
Lucrecia\!\!

**Lucrecia**  
Stay back\!\!

<div class="highlight">

There follows a sequence of flashbacks, set in Nibelheim:

Scene one: Vincent, as a Turk, and three scientists (Gast, Hojo, and Lucrecia) walk into the Shinra mansion. Vincent pauses near the gate to look up at the sky.

Scene two: Vincent and Lucrecia are talking to each other as they walk through Nibelheim.

Scene three: At Nibelheim's gate, Vincent is holding both of Lucrecia's hands in his. She breaks away and runs off out of town.

Scene four: Beneath the same gate, Lucrecia is in Hojo's arms, and Vincent is watching. He turns away, sighs, then runs off.

If she is happy then... I don't mind.

Scene five: Lucrecia is sitting in a chair at the inn, stroking her belly.

Scene six: Hojo, Lucrecia, and Vincent stand in the basement laboratory.

**Vincent**  
I'm against it\!\! Why experiments on humans\!?

Lucrecia lowers her head.

**Hojo**  
She and I are both scientists\!\!

After that, a child was born to Lucrecia...  
That child's name is...  
Sephiroth......

Scene seven: Lucrecia collapses on the floor in the inn.

Scene eight: Vincent runs down to the basement laboratory, making angry gestures at Hojo. Hojo runs his hands through his hair, then shoots Vincent, who crumples to the floor.

Scene nine: Hojo stands over Vincent at the basement's operating table.

Scene ten: Vincent gets up from the table and looks at his hands.

**Vincent**  
Urrrrrrrrgh\!\!

This body is... the punishment that's been given to me.  
I was unable...... to stop Professor Gast and Hojo...  
And Lucrecia... I was unable to stop them...  
All that I was able to do was watch... That is my punishment...

</div>

**Vincent**  
Lucrecia... You're alive...

**Lucrecia**  
I wanted to disappear... I couldn't be with anyone... I wanted to die...  
But the Jenova inside me wouldn't let me die...  
Lately, I dream a lot of Sephiroth... My dear, dear child.  
Ever since he was born I never got to hold him, even once...  
Not even once. You can't call me his mother... That... is my sin...

Vincent starts forward.

**Lucrecia**  
Back\!\! Stay back\!  
Vincent... Won't you please tell me?

**Vincent**  
......What?

**Lucrecia**  
If Sephiroth is still alive?  
I heard that he died five years ago. But I see him in my dreams so often...  
And I know that physically, like myself, he can't die so easily.  
Please, Vincent tell me......

Cloud starts forward, but Vincent holds out an arm to silence him.

**Vincent**  
Lucrecia... Sephiroth is dead...

They leave the cave.

If they return again later, Lucrecia is gone, but something has been left behind on the altar.

**Vincent**  
Lucrecia......

### Cosmo Canyon - Remembering Aeris

---

Cloud and his party arrive at Cosmo Canyon and go up to the observatory to see Bugenhagen.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. If you ever are in need of my wisdom, you are always welcome here.

**Cloud**  
Yeah, that's why we came.

**Bugenhagen**  
What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens we each have to take a good long look at ourselves.  
There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts.  
Something buried, or something forgotten.  
Remember it... Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are all looking for...

**Cloud**  
That's easy enough to say... But, I can't remember a thing.

**Bugenhagen**  
It must be there. Look harder\!

> **Barret**  
> This ain't no good with just us\! Cloud, we gotta get some others in here.
>
> **Tifa**  
> ...no good. Cloud, let's have the others come.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> nghh... no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> You expect me to know that? Let the others do it\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> How about it, Cloud? Shouldn't we have the others come?
>
> **Vincent**  
> I don't know, Cloud. I think we should have everyone here.
>
> **Cid**  
> Ahh, no good. Cloud you call the others in here too\!

Cloud nods and calls up the others on his PHS. They all gather in the observatory.

**Bugenhagen**  
Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?

**Cait Sith**  
Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing.

**Yuffie**  
Me either\! I don't get any of this\!

**Cloud**  
I remember Aeris a lot.  
No... not that.  
You haven't remembered.  
You haven't forgotten.  
That's not it...  
How would you say it... Aeris was right there all along. Right by our side.  
She was so close, we couldn't see her. What Aeris did... The words she left behind...

**Tifa**  
That reminds me... I was the same.

**Nanaki**  
......as was I.

**Barret**  
Me too...

**Cloud**  
She said she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's Meteor.

**Tifa**  
But Aeris is gone.

**Nanaki**  
Is it impossible for us to carry on... what Aeris tried to accomplish?

**Barret**  
We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.

**Cid**  
What, did that girl go off to that place?

**Cloud**  
That's it\!\!

**Cid**  
What's it?

**Cloud**  
We don't know about it.  
What did Aeris know?  
Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?

**Nanaki**  
I see... She returned there once again, correct?

**Bugenhagen**  
Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there.

**Nanaki**  
You're going too?

**Bugenhagen**  
What's so surprising about that...?  
Even I want to get out from time to time and see the outside world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages.

**Nanaki**  
It must be the planet. The planet is calling you\!

**Cid**  
Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling... right.

He walks out.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go.

The others all file out ahead of Cloud and Bugenhagen.

**Cloud**  
Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you.  
We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place...

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our way?  
I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You just pull this here...

The machine turns on, raising the platform into the planetarium. The Huge Materia Cloud has collected now hover amidst the model of the solar system.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia...?  
This is really rare Materia, indeed.  
Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness enclosed in it.

**Cloud**  
Huge Materia...  
It is glowing strangely...  
\- Get closer...  
\- Leave it alone  
\- Go back down

On approaching the green Huge Materia:

<div class="highlight">

The Huge Materia emitted a gentle glow.

</div>

**Cloud**  
This color... it's the same color as magic Materia.

On approaching the yellow Huge Materia:

<div class="highlight">

The Huge Materia emitted a quiet glow.

</div>

**Cloud**  
This color... it's the same color as command Materia.

On approaching the red Huge Materia:

<div class="highlight">

The Huge Materia emitted a fiery glow.

</div>

**Cloud**  
This color... it's the same color as summoned Materia.

On approaching the blue Huge Materia:

<div class="highlight">

The Huge Materia emitted a cold glow.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Is that... Bahamut...?

Once Cloud decides to go back down...

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave.  
Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever want to see Materia, come here anytime.

---

Back on the Highwind, Bugenhagen hovers outside the Operation room.

**Bugenhagen**  
Hm, hmm, hmm\!.......  
Smells like machinery.  
I love this smell.  
Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too......  
Hm? Is the deck up there?  
Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time.  
I can feel the workings of the planet in the smell of the wind.  
I also feel the greatness of man's wisdom and the knowledge in the smell of machinery...  
Well, bye for now.

He floats off to the deck above.

I wonder where you're taking me?

**Yuffie**  
Cloud...... urp...... ugh.  
You know, I was thinking...... phew...... Why does materia always have something to do with battles or magic?  
I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.  
It must've been... ugh... terrible...

**Barret**  
And Aeris... she's dead.  
Guess she turned into spiritual energy and returned to the planet, huh?  
But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again...

**Tifa**  
I wonder what Aeris felt... when she was on that altar...?

**Cloud**  
I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the planet...

**Tifa**  
Really? I wonder? I don't think that's it at all.  
I think she didn't think she would die at all, but that she planned on coming back all along.  
She always used to talk about the 'Next time'.  
She talked about the future more than any of us...  
Although she never talked about it to us she must've had a rough life...  
I think Aeris looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone...  
...she must've had many many dreams......

**Nanaki**  
Aeris used to pat me on the nose sometimes.  
I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention.  
I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met.

**Cait Sith**  
I went an' told Aeris' Mom about her death.  
Yes, an' Miss Elmyra was cryin' herself silly... So was little Marlene...

**Vincent**  
City of the Ancients...  
The Ancients... after a long time that is probably what others will come to call us...  
Hmmm... hwa ha ha ha... It's only a matter of time for us.

**Cid**  
Aeris...?  
I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind......

**Learner Pilot (LV11)**  
Okay then, let's go\!

**Cloud**  
\- Let's go\!  
\- Wait a sec......

Cloud and the others set out for the City of the Ancients.

---

If you speak to some of the villagers while Bugenhagen is with the party...

**Elder Hargo** (in the observatory)  
I hope great Bugenhagen will take care and not overexert himself.  
'Ho Ho Hoooo.' I may be light, But I'm not as young as Nanaki.  
Oops. That will only get you angry. You're just like me. Ho ho ho.

**Kid in Nanaki's Room**  
Both Nanaki and Mr. Bugenhagen are gone... I feel so lonely...

Or, if Nanaki is in the party:

That Nanaki's slick\! He said, 'I'll protect this canyon'\! But he didn't. I don't care about Nanaki anymore...

**Nanaki**  
Sorry... I'm really sorry. But now, I have......

#### [Back on the Highwind](#highwind)

---

<span id="arrival"></span>Cloud and the others take Bugenhagen into the City of the Ancients and to the viewing chamber with the large crystal platform.

**Bugenhagen**  
This is...  
Yes...... exactly...

**Cloud**  
Are you getting something?

**Bugenhagen**  
...give me a moment.

Bugenhagen floats up to the platform in the center of the room. Cloud joins him.

**Bugenhagen**  
The knowledge of the Ancients swirling around here is telling me one thing.  
The planet's in a crisis...  
A crisis beyond human power or endless time.  
It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'.

**Cloud**  
Holy?

**Bugenhagen**  
Holy... the ultimate White Magic. Magic that might stand against Meteor. Perhaps our last hope to save the planet from Meteor.  
If a soul seeking Holy reaches the planet, it will appear.  
Ho Ho Hooo.  
Meteor, Weapon, everything will disappear.  
Perhaps, even ourselves.

**Cloud**  
Even us\!?

**Bugenhagen**  
It is up to the planet to decide.  
What is best for the planet. What is bad for the planet.  
All that is bad will disappear. That is all.  
Ho Ho Hooo.  
I wonder which we humans are?

**Cloud**  
Search for Holy... How do we do it?

**Bugenhagen**  
Speak to the planet.  
Get the White Materia... This will bond the Planet to humans.  
Then speak to the planet.  
If our wish reaches the planet, the White Materia will begin to glow a pale green.

**Cloud**  
...This is the end.  
Aeris had the White Materia...  
But when Aeris died, it fell from the altar...  
That's why...... this is the end.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hooo\!  
Ho Ho Hooo\!  
Ho Ho Hooo\!  
Look at this\!

**Cloud**  
\!?

**Bugenhagen**  
Ancients' writing.

**Cloud**  
Can you read it?

**Bugenhagen**  
I can't even make it out\!\!

**Cloud**  
This's no time for jokes...

**Bugenhagen**  
I'm not an Ancient. I can't read this thing\!  
I may be old, but my eyes aren't completely bad yet. Look closely below the writing.

<span id="key"></span>**Cloud**  
There's something written in chalk... ...... (even sunlight can't reach)...... (Key)

Or, if Cloud has already obtained the Key:

There's something written in chalk... ...(key)... (in the Music Box)

**Bugenhagen**  
It was probably written by a scientist who's been here... He probably used all his energy to make out these two words.

**Cloud**  
Key......? To what?

**Bugenhagen**  
I don't know... But, it probably has something to do with our riddle.  
The riddle... then it must have something to do with Aeris.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you don't have the Key...</span>

**Cloud**  
So this note points to where the key is?

**Bugenhagen**  
Probably...  
Use these words as clues and go find the key.  
I'll continue to figure out the Ancients' writing.

**Cloud**  
A place (Even sunlight won't reach) is where the (key) is, right?

**Bugenhagen**  
When you find the key, or when you can't go any further, come back here.  
Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new information for you.

Cloud nods.

**Bugenhagen**  
Remember, a place (even sunlight can't reach) is where the (key) is...

Cloud leaves the city to look for the key. Back on the Highwind...

**Barret**  
Whacha gonna do, Cloud? Got any good ideas?

**Tifa**  
Cloud......

**Nanaki**  
If I were more of an adult... Perhaps, I would have a better idea of what to do?  
Phew... I wish I could grow up.  
I wonder if I'll be an adult after all this is over?

**Cait Sith**  
Lately, they don't call me to no more meetin's. Reckon that's because y'all know I'm a spy.

**Vincent**  
......feelings alone aren't enough. ...it's irritating, isn't it Cloud?

**Cid**  
Phew...... Cloud. What're gonna do?

**Yuffie**  
Are you waiting for Cloud?  
He's flying right now, so you can't get him.  
Were you going to force me into the submarine right now?  
Quit it\! If you want to go, then just leave me behind.  
............ooooooh. What're you talking about? I......

**Learner Pilot (L12)**  
Cloud, let's go\!

**Cloud**  
\- Okay\! Let's go\!  
\- Uh, wait a sec\!

If the party returns to the City of the Ancients, Bugenhagen will offer them new insights.

**Bugenhagen**  
(even sunlight can't reach)... Hmm... if we're above ground, and sunlight reaches everywhere... Then it's probably not above ground...

On visiting again...

**Bugenhagen**  
A place where sunlight doesn't reach... Right, it must be underwater\!

**Cloud**  
Underwater? There's... no way... We need a submarine...  
Wait. Submarine... I think there's one at Junon Port......

Searching in the submarine, they find it in an underwater tunnel in the north.

**Cloud**  
Do you think it's......?

Or, if you obtained the red submarine:

You think it could be...?

<div class="highlight-nopad">

...analysis completed...  
...exact date of origin cannot be determined...  
...estimated to be several thousand years old...

</div>

**Cloud**  
Key of the Ancients...

<div class="highlight-nopad">

Received Key Item "Key to Ancients"\!

</div>

They return to the City of the Ancients.

**Bugenhagen**  
Oh\! You've found it\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If you've already obtained the Key...</span>

**Cloud**  
What does it mean?

</div>

**Bugenhagen**  
That Music Box over there. We'll put the key in it.  
I'll go use the key. You all wait here.  
And watch closely what happens.  
Ho Ho Hooo\!

Bugenhagen puts the key in the music box, a tune plays, and a waterfall crashes down over the center platform. Bugenhagen rejoins the others just outside the waterfall.

**Bugenhagen**  
Now, go inside. Hope may be inside... Or......

Cloud and the others pass through the waterfall to look.

**Bugenhagen**  
This was just a screen to project an image\!  
Look\! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water\!

They watch as the screen shows the White Materia at Aeris's death. After it drops into the water, it begins to glow green.

**Cloud**  
...It's glowing.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho Hooo\!\! It's pale green\!\!

**Cloud**  
...Aeris. Aeris has already prayed for Holy.  
...After I gave up the Black Materia to Sephiroth...... Aeris' words came into my dreams...  
She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth...... And to do that, there was a secret here...  
That was Holy...... That's why, she had the White Materia. Aeris knew about here... and what she had to do.  
Aeris has left us great hope. But, it cost her her life... her future...  
I'm sorry... Aeris. I should have figured this out sooner.  
...You left us without saying a word...... It was all so sudden, so I couldn't think...  
That's why it took so long for me to find out... But, Aeris... I understand now.  
Aeris... I'll do the rest.

Cloud looks at his companions and nods.

**Cloud**  
Thank you... Aeris.  
Aeris' voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the glow of the White Materia.  
But...... how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving?  
Why?

**Bugenhagen**  
Something's getting in its way.

**Cloud**  
......Him......  
He's the only one that could do it.  
...Sephiroth. Where are you?

Cloud turns to go. If Cait Sith is in the party, he stops them with an exclamation. Otherwise, Cloud's PHS rings. Cloud responds to both with "What the?" and the rest of the conversation proceeds identically.

**Cait Sith**  
H... Hey\!

**Cloud**  
What the?

<div class="highlight">

**Cait Sith**  
whisper... whisper... (sorry I was a little surprised).

</div>

**Cloud**  
What happened?

<div class="highlight">

**Cait Sith**  
You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus moved it.

</div>

**Cloud**  
Moved it? That big thing......? Where...? Why?

<div class="highlight">

**Cait Sith**  
Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it.  
That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has already been used in the Rocket Plan.  
So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it.  
To a place where Materia... no, where Mako is gathered...

</div>

**Cloud**  
And, where is that\!?

---

<span id="shinra"></span>Cut to Midgar, where the Sister Ray has been set up extending from Shinra Headquarters. In the President's office, the executives are gathered...

**Rufus**  
......That's why, Reeve. It's your job to adjust the reactor's output.

**Reeve**  
I see......

**Scarlet**  
Hah, hah, hah\! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve.  
Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed\!

**Heidegger**  
Gya hah, hah, hah\! The President's sure done it this time\!  
If we can only defeat Sephiroth, the idea that Meteor will also disappear is based on different objectives\!

**Scarlet**  
Please remember, Mr. President...  
It was my idea to fire Mako reactor powered shells.

**Rufus**  
Will the shells really reach the far northern border?

**Scarlet**  
Ah, hah hah\!  
Of course\!  
But Mr. President, please do not call it a Mako cannon.  
This new weapon will be called......  
The Sister Ray\!

---

Cloud and the others leave the City of the Ancients, but before getting on the Highwind, Cloud turns.

**Cloud**  
............?  
Wh, what the...\!?

<span id="highwind"></span>From the sea just south of Bone Village, Diamond Weapon rises and begins walking south towards Midgar. Back on the Highwind, red lights flash.

**Cid**  
What's wrong\!?

**Crew Member**  
It's a strange signal\!

**Cid**  
From where?

**Crew Member** (turning towards Cait Sith)  
It's coming from this... person(?)

**Cait Sith**  
Wow\!  
Hey\!  
That was a surprise, the controls went crazy.  
This ain't good...  
Weapon came out of the sea and is heading straight for Midgar.

**Cloud**  
The new weapon should stop him, right?

**Cait Sith**  
I don't know if it's ready or not...

**Barret**  
Hey\! What's gonna happen to Marlene\!?

**Cait Sith**  
Doncha worry none, Marlene's in a safe place. She's with Aeris' mama.  
Barret\!\!  
What was that scratching just now\!?  
As long as Marlene is safe, who cares what else happens, right?  
I been itchin' to say this to ya fer a while now\!  
When ya blew the Midgar No. 1 up, how many folks d'ya think died?

**Barret**  
...that was for the life of the planet. Ya gotta expect a few casualties.

**Cait Sith**  
A few? Whaddya mean 'a few'? What may be a few to y'all is everythin' to them who died......  
Protect the planet. Hah\! Y'all sure sound good\!  
Ain't no one that'd go against ya. So ya think ya can do whatever y'all want?

**Barret**  
I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra...

**Cait Sith**  
......nuthin' I can do 'bout that...

**Cloud**  
Stop it\!

**Tifa**  
Cait Sith...... Barret, he knows what he did.  
What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the reason.

She turns to Barret.

Right? We haven't forgotten, right?

She turns back to Cait Sith.

I know you.  
You can't quit the company because you're worried about the people in Midgar, right?  
......Cloud?

**Cloud**  
OK\! Let's go\! We'll beat Weapon ourselves\!

**Cid**  
Hey Cloud......  
You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of winnin', right?

**Cloud**  
How would I know?  
But that's no reason for us to just let him go\!  
We're goin' to Midgar and fight Weapon\! Come on, let's move\!

**Barret**  
That damn Weapon... He's one big \*&$\*&%$...  
Even Midgar's gonna be in trouble.

**Tifa**  
Whether you love it or hate it...  
You just can't bring yourself to leave Midgar, can you?

**Nanaki**  
Midgar...  
I hated the fact I was caught by Hojo and taken back to the lab where they did all kinds of experiments on me...  
But because of that I was able to meet you all...  
People you meet... others you don't...... strange isn't it?

**Cait Sith**  
Cloud, you do your best now, hear\!?  
I know y'all can't forgive the Shinra, but them poor folks in Midgar ain't done a bit wrong\!

**Vincent**  
......we still can't seem to get near Sephiroth...

**Cid**  
That reminds me, there was a test rocket that landed in the Slums of Midgar long ago.  
I remember I was relieved when I heard it never blew up.

**Bugenhagen**  
Traveling is wonderful, isn't it?......

**Learner Pilot (L13)**  
Cloud\! I'm going\!

**Cloud**  
\- Okay  
\- Excuse me, but could you wait?

Cloud and the others head for Midgar.

If, in following Diamond Weapon, the Highwind rams into it...

**Cid**  
Hey, HEY\! What're ya tryin' to do? Break the Highwind? Let's fight on the ground\!

They reach and fight Diamond Weapon some miles outside of Midgar, but cannot defeat it. It turns towards Midgar, leaving them behind.

> **Barret**  
> Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What's wrong? Are you still looking for something...?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Something's wrong...
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Huh? It's looking somewhere else. Doesn't it want to fight us?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> What's going on?
>
> **Vincent**  
> Doesn't look like it's after us. Something else...
>
> **Cid**  
> What's wrong? It's like you're blowing us off\!

**Cloud**  
No, it's...... feeling something. ......Yeah, it senses murder.

> **Barret**  
> Let's go back to the Highwind\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Let's go to the Airship\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Let's watch from the Airship\!
>
> **Yuffie**  
> OK, can we GO now\!?

> **Cait Sith**  
> Let's go back to the Airship.
>
> **Vincent**  
> We should go back to the ship now.
>
> **Cid**  
> To my ship\!

The others run out. If Cait Sith is in the party, he hangs back with Cloud.

**Cait Sith**  
Oh no\! We gotta get outta here\!  
Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'\!

Otherwise, Cloud's PHS rings.

<div class="highlight">

**Cait Sith**  
Oh no\! Let's hurry out of here\!  
Something big... I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'\!

</div>

---

<span id="sisterray"></span>Meanwhile at Shinra Headquarters, Rufus now stands alone in his office.

<div class="highlight">

**Heidegger**  
Hah, hah, hah, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are now in order.

</div>

<div class="highlight">

**Scarlet**  
Hah, hah, hah\!  
Anytime is fine.

</div>

**Rufus** (laughing)  
......Fire.

---

Drawing power from all of Midgar's reactors, the Sister Ray fires a shot northward. The glass on the Shinra building shatters. Diamond Weapon fires a salvo back at Midgar. On the deck of the Highwind, Cloud and the others stand watching.

**Tifa**  
Which direction is it going to attack from?

**Nanaki**  
Midgar\!

**Barret**  
Marlene\!\!

The shot from the Sister Ray goes right through Diamond Weapon as the Highwind flies past. The Weapon flies back.

**Barret**  
Damn...

**Nanaki**  
It went right through Weapon......

**Cloud**  
I see\! They're after Sephiroth\! The crater on the Northern boundary\!

---

The shot continues on to the Northern Crater and slams into Sephiroth's barrier, destroying it. Back at Shinra Headquarters...

<div class="highlight">

**(operator)**  
Sir\! Weapon's been defeated\!\!  
The barrier has disappeared\!

There is a pause.

Sir\! A mass of high density energy is heading towards Midgar\!

</div>

Rufus turns and looks. In the street below, people are running away from the Shinra building.

**People Fleeing**  
WHOOA-- Weapon's attacking\!  
Run for your lives\!\!

Rufus stands in his office as the blast hits the upper floors of the Shinra building.

---

Back on the Highwind, Cloud and the others have returned to the bridge.

**Cloud**  
What happened to...... Sephiroth?  
Northern Cave...  
Let's go see what happened to it.

**Barret**  
When AVALANCHE was jes startin', we used to put up flyers everywhere.  
And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that?  
Feels like a long time ago.

**Tifa**  
Now we're going to fight Sephiroth.  
I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?

**Nanaki**  
Will we save the world if we beat Sephiroth?  
I'm frightened, but I'll do my best. Let's hurry to the Northern Cave\!

**Cait Sith**  
......Wonder what that Sephiroth feller's up to?

**Vincent**  
Defeat Sephiroth... Defeat the son of that beloved woman...  
Am I on the verge of committing another sin......?  
Or am I atoning as best I can for only watching...?

**Cid**  
Maybe this is the time?

**Yuffie**  
What's the pilot like?  
Tell him Yuffie says if he pilots the plane smoothly, give him my autograph...

**Learner Pilot (L14)**  
Hey, Cloud\!\!\!

**Cloud**  
\- Y, yeah, let's go\!  
\- U, uh wait

They fly to the Northern Crater, finding the barrier gone.

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone......  
Cid\! Can the Airship get inside?

**Cid**  
Huh? He's my student, ain't he\!? Of course he can go anywhere\!

**Cloud**  
Right, sorry about that.

<span id="hq"></span>Cait Sith gives a sudden start.

**Barret**  
Yo, Cait Sith\! Now what?

**Cait Sith**  
Hold it\!  
Scarlet\! Heidegger\! What's going on?

---

Back at Shinra Headquarters, Reeve, Heidegger, and Scarlet stand in the conference room.

**Heidegger**  
Strange. I can't reach the President\!

**Reeve**  
Not the President. To Sister Ray\!

**Scarlet**  
Ha, ha, ha. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely.

**Reeve**  
None of that matters\!  
The reactor's output is increasing all by itself\!

**Scarlet**  
Ww, wait a minute. That's not wise\!  
It must cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off the machine\!

**Reeve**  
We can't do that\! It's inoperable\!

He pulls out his cell phone.

<div class="highlight">

Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation\!  
We can't operate it from here.

</div>

**Reeve**  
What about the mainframe? Who\!?

He turns to Heidegger.

Hey, call the mainframe\!

**Heidegger**  
Huh? Why are you giving orders?

**Reeve**  
I don't give a damn about the details\!\!

---

At the Sister Ray's controls...

**Hojo**  
Ha, ha, ha...... Just you wait, Sephiroth.  
I'll give you all the Mako you want.

<div class="highlight">

**Reeve**  
Hojo, STOP\! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger\!

</div>

**Hojo**  
Ha, ha, ha...... One or two Midgars? ...it's a small price to pay.

<div class="highlight">

**Reeve**  
Hojo\! HOJO......\!\!

</div>

**Hojo**  
Show me...... Sephiroth.  
It should be near...  
Ha, ha, ha...... Go beyond the powers of science...  
Before your presence, science is powerless...  
I hate it, but I'll concede to it.  
Just... let me see it.  
Ha, ha, ha......

---

Back on the Highwind...

**Barret**  
YO\! Do somethin'\! Ya big cat\!

**Cait Sith**  
We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own......  
...? ...? H, huh\!?  
I don't like this......

**Barret**  
You're busted, Reeve\!  
Too late tryin' to hide it now...

**Cloud**  
Can't you stop the Mako reactor?

**Cait Sith**  
......We can't stop it.

**Barret**  
You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible\!?

**Cait Sith**  
............

**Cid**  
We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us now\!

**Cait Sith**  
I can't make you trust me......

**Cid**  
You damn fool\! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?  
I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man... no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet\! Don't you even care?

**Cait Sith**  
No way\! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose\!\!

**Cid**  
Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?

**Cait Sith**  
Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves......  
But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below.  
Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until everything blasts out...  
And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out......

**Barret**  
An explosion\!\!

**Cait Sith**  
This blast'll be way stronger than when the number 1 reactor blew up\!

**Barret**  
Damn...\!

**Cait Sith**  
Forget about that......... the CANNON\! We've got to get to Midgar\! That's the first thing\!\!

**Cloud**  
Must stop Hojo... first.

---

At Shinra HQ...

**Reeve**  
Looks like Cloud and the others are on their way. Stay out of the way\!

**Heidegger**  
Ghaa haah hah hah\!  
Don't be so ludicrous\! I don't recall you giving me any orders\!  
The Peace Preservation will give their best effort to make the enemy retreat\!  
Because of them, I...... I...\!

**Reeve**  
That's a private matter......

**Heidegger**  
The President is dead\! Now I'm doing things my way\!  
Ghaa haah hah hah\!

**Scarlet**  
Ha, ha, ha.  
Heidegger\! Now I'm going to use the new weapon\!

Two Shinra soldiers run in to restrain Reeve. Scarlet and Heidegger leave the Conference Room.

**Reeve**  
Hey\! Wait\!\!  
Cloud, everybody\! Sorry......  
But\!\!

---

<span id="descent"></span>Back on the Highwind...

**Cait Sith**  
But\!  
But you'll come, won't you\!?

**Cloud**  
I know\!

Cid turns to the pilot.

**Cid**  
Hey\!  
I'm leaving the ship in your hands\!

**Pilot**  
I'm heading for Midgar\!

**Barret**  
Comin' and goin'... gettin' pushed around.  
But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay...

**Tifa**  
It's all right.  
You're here... Everyone's all together  
Together... we can do anything. We've worked this hard already.

**Nanaki**  
I wonder why Hojo performed so many of these experiments?  
Why couldn't he content himself with quiet research?

**Cait Sith**  
I can't 'pologize to y'all enough.  
If I was just a bit more o' a better feller Ain't none of this woulda happened...

**Vincent**  
Hojo... what a queer fellow.  
Such utter lack of scientific talent... compared with the genius of Dr. Gast......  
Lucrecia chose him trying to protect him...  
Now I understand... I understand... but...

**Cid**  
We're busy runnin' back and forth\!  
Even my bikini goddess would be pantin' about now\!

**Yuffie**  
Headed for... Midgar?  
Uh, a, anywhere's fine... I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing.

**Learner Pilot (LV14 Limit Break\!)**  
Yo, Cloud\! Whacha gonna do?

**Cloud**  
\- Move it\!  
\- Wait

They fly the Highwind back to Midgar.

**Pilot**  
We've reached Midgar\!

**Barret**  
Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law\!  
There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.

**Tifa**  
Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off......

**Cid**  
Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?  
Where are we now\!?

**Barret**  
Huh? Where are we...?

**Cid**  
If land's no go... We'll go by air\!

**Cloud**  
Okay then\! We'll parachute into Midgar\!\!

Everyone runs from the bridge and gathers on the deck outside.

**Cloud**  
Here we go\!\!

They all jump off the Highwind and parachute into Midgar, landing in 8th Street, Sector 8. Cait Sith approaches Cloud once he's landed.

**Cait Sith**  
Heidegger is going after you all.  
That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground\!

Cloud joins the others around an entrance to the Sector 8 underground.

**Barret**  
Sounds strange comin' from me...  
But it feels like home bein' back in Midgar.  
Kinda makes me sick...

**Tifa**  
We sure got to know the Midgar underground.

**Nanaki**  
I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's hurry and go\!

**Yuffie**  
This place smells gross. Let's get this over with\!

**Vincent**  
So it was Hojo who stirred up all this commotion, after all these years...?

**Cid**  
Yeah\! Let's get it over with\!

**Cait Sith**  
This is where we go in.

He opens a grate into the underground.

Please\! Hurry and come to the Mako Cannon\!

Cloud and the others make their way through the underground and reach the train tunnels. If Cloud travels backwards down the tunnel instead of ahead, he first comes across Barret.

**Barret**  
Leave this to me\! Hurry to the cannon\!

He starts firing towards their rear.

Farther back, he encounters Nanaki at the branch marked 2.

**Nanaki**  
I smell it\! The cannon's not this way\!

He runs in the other direction.

Going back far enough, Cloud will reach the end of the tunnel, and the W-Item materia.

**Cloud**  
Dead end\!

<span id="turks"></span>Going forward again, eventually the Turks will intercept Cloud.

**Elena**  
Oh no\! They're here\!

Cloud and the others turn to face her.

**Elena**  
What are we going to do\!? I think it's okay for you to ignore your orders now.

Reno and Rude walk up from behind her.

**Reno**  
...Elena, don't act so weak.

**Rude**  
We're Turks, Elena.

**Elena**  
...Yes, sir. You're right.

**Rude**  
Come on, we've got work to do.

**Reno**  
I'm not really up for it, but...

**Elena**  
Our orders were to seek you out and...  
...Kill.  
Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.  
That's the will and spirit of the Turks\! Believe it\!

If you completed the Wutai sidequest with Don Corneo, the dialogue continues. Otherwise, Cloud and the others will automatically enter a battle with all three Turks.

**Cloud**  
......

**Elena**  
What are you doing\! Let's go\!

**Cloud**  
\- Okay, let's end this  
\- No, let's not go

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Okay, let's end this</span>

**Reno**  
I know we have a weird relationship, but...  
We have to end this... like Turks\!

A battle ensues.

**Elena**  
Try this on for size\!  
Yeow\! That hurts\!  
Take THAT\!\!

**Rude**  
............

**Rude** (on defeat)  
Reno\! Elena\! Let's pull out\!

**Reno** (on defeat)  
Let's call it a day.

They flee.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No, let's not go</span>

**Elena**  
You showing pity\!? Don't take the Turks for fools\!

**Reno**  
Wait, Elena.

**Elena**  
Reno\! You're not violating the order... are you\!?

**Reno**  
Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.

**Rude**  
......

**Elena**  
Rude...

**Reno**  
Elena, you were a great Turk\!

**Elena**  
......

**Reno**  
Farewell. If we both survive...  
If we can save our lives...

He walks off.

**Elena**  
Remember the spirit of the Turks...\!

She salutes and runs off.

**Rude**  
Our mission's finished...

He follows the others.

</div>

Cloud and the others move on. At the first branch in the tunnel, they find Yuffie.

**Yuffie**  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon---\!

In the tunnel beyond, Tifa is crouched down on the tracks. She stands.

**Tifa**  
I'm all right\! Hurry and go to the cannon\!

At the next branch is Cid.

**Cid**  
Which way...\!?  
Goddamn, piece of $\#@^% cannon\!\!

Going left from here takes them to the Shinra building. As they approach the entrance...

**Cait Sith**  
No, no\! The Sister Ray's not this way\!

It is possible to enter the Shinra building anyway, but it is empty of employees except for the 66th floor, which Cloud can only view from the stairwell.

**2nd Floor Shop**  
Welcome... to the fully automated store. Place your order... now.

**63rd Floor Computer**  
......ga...... ......gaga...... ga......

On the 64th floor, if Cloud put money into the vending machine earlier...

**Cloud**  
......  
...Is it broken?'  
\- BANG on it  
\- Give up

<div class="highlight">

Received "Mind Source"\!

</div>

<div class="highlight">

Received "Speed Source"\!

</div>

Eventually Cloud and the others emerge into the streets of Sector 8 again, near the supports for the cannon. They start down the street, but the ground begins shaking, and they stop and look back.

**Cait Sith**  
No, no way...... I didn't know they completed it...

A huge robot comes to a stop behind them and a hatch opens.

**Heidegger**  
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa\!\!\! Here they come\!  
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa\!\!\! So they really showed up\!

Heidegger and Scarlet step out onto the robot's hand.

**Heidegger**  
You sure did treat us like dogs up to now\!\!

**Scarlet**  
You killed off a lot of my precious soldiers\!

**Heidegger**  
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa\!\!\! But let's see how you do against anti-Weapon artillery\!

**Scarlet**  
You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is a sure thing\!

They go back inside the hatch.

**Scarlet**  
I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod\!

A battle ensues, and they defeat the Proud Clod.

**Scarlet**  
Not that\! This is the proud Clod.........\!?

**Heidegger**  
Whoooooa\!\!

The Proud Clod explodes.

**Cait Sith**  
We don't got any time\! Please get on with it\!

<span id="hojo"></span>It starts to rain, and Cloud and the others move on down the street and start up the stairs to the Sister Ray.

**Cait Sith**  
This way, Cloud\!

**Vincent** (on a lower platform, watching)  
Damn\! Hojo...\!

If Barret is in the party, there is a treasure chest on the stairs.

**Barret**  
Hey\! This is...

<div class="highlight">

Received "Missing Score"\!

</div>

**Barret**  
This is great. Hold on, Hojo......\!

They climb to the top of the stairs and reach Hojo, who is working at the cannon's controls.

**Cloud**  
Hojo\! Stop right there\!\!

**Hojo**  
Oh... the failure.

**Cloud**  
At least remember my name\! It's Cloud\!

**Hojo**  
Every time I see you, I...  
It pains me that I had so little scientific sense...  
I evaluated you as a failed project.  
But, you are the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.  
Heh, heh, heh...... I'm even beginning to hate myself.

**Cloud**  
None of that matters... just stop this nonsense\!

**Hojo** (pausing)  
...nonsense?  
Oh, this?

He turns around.

Ha, ha, ha...  
Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy.  
So I'm going to lend him a hand.

**Cloud**  
Why\!? Why do that\!?

**Hojo**  
Quit asking me why, you moron.  
Hmm... actually, you might be cut out to be a scientist.

He turns back to the controls.

Energy level is at...... 83%. It's taking too long.  
My son is in need of power and help. ...That's the only reason.

**Cloud**  
...your son?

**Hojo**  
Ha, ha, ha... Although he doesn't know.  
Ha, ha, ha... HA, HA, HA...\!\!  
What will Sephiroth think when he finds out I'm his father?  
Always looking down on me like that.  
HA, HA, HA...\!\!

**Cloud**  
Sephiroth is your son\!?

**Vincent**  
......\!

**Hojo**  
Ha, ha, ha...  
I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.  
When Sephiroth was still in the womb, we took the cells of Jenova...  
HA, HA, HA\!\!

**Vincent**  
You......\!

**Cloud**  
I can't believe you're the one who did this...  
The illusionary crime against Sephiroth...

Hojo turns around.

**Hojo**  
Heee, hee, hee, hee\! No you're wrong\!  
It's my desire as a scientist\! Heee, hee, hee, hee\!

**Vincent**  
......  
I was...... wrong. The one that should have slept was...  
...You, Hojo\!

**Hojo**  
I... was defeated by my desire to become a scientist.  
I lost the last time as well.  
I've injected Jenova's cells into my own body\!  
Heee, hee, hee\!  
Here are......  
Heee, hee, hee\!  
...my results\!\!

Cloud and the others enter a battle with Hojo.

**Hojo**  
Gwah, haw, haw\!\!  
Haw... now let's see  
how the Mako juice is reacting?

Hojo morphs into Helletic Hojo, and later into Lifeform Hojo. Cloud and the others manage to defeat him.

**Cloud**  
......

### The Highwind - What We're Fighting For

#### [Cloud's Speech](#speech)

#### [Cloud and Tifa Await the Others' Return](#wait)

#### [Back on the Highwind](#highwind)

---

<span id="speech"></span>Everyone has gathered back on the bridge of the Highwind.

**Cait Sith**  
Shinra's...... finished.

**Cloud**  
Meteor's gonna fall in about......

**Nanaki**  
Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said.

**Cloud**  
Nanaki......  
You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again?

**Nanaki**  
.........yes.

**Cloud** (turning to Barret)  
You want to see Marlene, right?

**Barret**  
Don't ask me that.

**Cloud**  
We'll beat Sephiroth...  
Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven days......  
There won't be a planet left to protect.  
If we can't beat Sephiroth...  
It's as good as death for us.  
We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from Meteor.

**Barret**  
Don't be thinkin' you're gonna lose before ya even fight\!

**Cloud**  
No\!  
What I meant was...  
What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that.  
Save the planet... for the future of the planet... Sure, that's all fine.  
But really, is that really how it is?  
For me, this is a personal feud.  
I want to beat Sephiroth. And settle my past.  
Saving the planet just happens to be part of that.  
I've been thinking.  
I think we all are fighting for ourselves.  
For ourselves... and that someone... something... whatever it is, that's important to us.  
That's what we're fighting for.  
That's why we keep up this battle for the planet.

**Barret**  
You're right...  
It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the planet.  
But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor......  
Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things.  
I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer...  
...At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town.  
But now......  
Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene.  
For Marlene... For Marlene's future...  
Yeah... I guess I want to save the planet for Marlene's sake...

**Cloud**  
Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back.  
All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for yourselves.  
I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back.

**Cid**  
Maybe ain't none of us'll come back.  
Meteor's gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any useless struggling\!

**Cloud**  
I know why I'm fighting.  
I'm fighting to save the planet, and that's that.  
But besides that, there's something personal too...  
A very personal memory that I have.  
What about you all?  
I want all of you to find that something within yourselves.  
If you don't find it, then that's okay too.  
You can't fight without a reason, right?  
So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back.

<span id="wait"></span>Everyone leaves, including the Highwind's crew, except for Tifa. Cloud turns to her.

**Cloud**  
What are you going to do, Tifa?

**Tifa**  
Did you forget?  
I'm... all alone. I don't have anywhere to go.

Cloud and Tifa leave the airship and stand below in the twilight.

**Tifa**  
Everyone's gone...

**Cloud**  
Yeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to.

**Tifa**  
You're right...  
But... I'm sure someday... they'll come back, don't you think?

**Cloud**  
Hmm... I wonder...?  
Everyone has an irreplaceable something they're holding on to...  
But this time, our opponent...

**Tifa**  
Hmm... But that's all right, even if no one comes back.  
As long as I'm with you... As long as you're by my side... I won't give up even if I'm scared.

**Cloud**  
.........Tifa......

**Tifa**  
No matter how close we are... We were far apart... before this.  
But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice...  
...sniff... you probably don't remember this...  
But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name... Or at least I thought I did...

Depending on Cloud's actions throughout the game, the dialogue continues differently.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud has favored Tifa...</span>

**Cloud**  
Yeah... At that time I heard you calling me.  
You were calling me back from the stream of consciousness in the Lifestream.  
After all, I promised. That if anything were to ever happen to you, I would come to help.

**Tifa**  
Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?  
Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?

**Cloud**  
I dunno... But...  
Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves...  
Someday we'll find the answer. Right, Tifa?  
That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream.

**Tifa**  
Yeah...... that's right...

**Cloud**  
Hey Tifa...... I...... There are a lot of things I wanted to talk to you about.  
But now that we're together like this, I don't know what I really wanted to say...  
I guess nothing's changed at all... Kind of makes you want to laugh...

**Tifa**  
Cloud... Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking...

**Cloud**  
............

Cloud and Tifa spend the night on the ground beneath the airship, Tifa leaning against Cloud.

**Cloud**  
............It's almost dawn...

**Tifa**  
H, huh...?

**Cloud**  
Sorry. Did I wake you...? It's almost dawn, Tifa.

**Tifa**  
Umm... G, good morning... Cloud.  
Give me a little longer... Just a little bit longer...

She leans back against him.

This day will never come again... So let me have this moment...

**Cloud**  
Yeah... okay.  
This is probably the last time we'll have together......

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If Cloud hasn't favored Tifa as much...</span>

**Cloud**  
I see......  
I think I've heard about it, too.  
At that time, it was Tifa's voice......

**Tifa**  
Cloud...? Do you think the stars can hear us?  
Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?

**Cloud**  
I dunno... But...  
Whether they are or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves...  
I'll find the answer someday. As long as I keep trying.

**Tifa**  
Yeah...... that's right...

**Cloud**  
We've got a big battle tomorrow, we'd better get some sleep...

**Tifa**  
Umm. Yes, I guess you're right......

Cloud and Tifa spend the night on the ground beneath the airship, Tifa leaning against Cloud.

**Cloud**  
............It's almost dawn...

**Tifa**  
H, huh...?

**Cloud**  
Morning, Tifa. It's almost dawn...

**Tifa**  
Mmm...... Good morning, Cloud.  
Give me a little longer... Just a little big longer...

She leans back against him.

This day will never come again... So let me have this moment...

**Cloud**  
............

</div>

Later, some time after the sun has risen, Tifa stands looking up at the Highwind.

**Tifa**  
.........

**Cloud**  
We'd better go.

**Tifa**  
But, I still...\!?

**Cloud**  
It's all right, Tifa. You said so yourself yesterday.  
At least we don't have to go on alone.

**Tifa**  
Yes... That's right\!

**Cloud**  
Okay\! Let's go\!

<span id="highwind"></span>Together they return to the Highwind.

**Tifa**  
The airship is too big for just the two of us.  
Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone.

**Cloud**  
Don't worry. It'll be okay.  
I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone.  
Besides, I'm the pilot.  
No more flying around casually like before.  
We won't have time to feel lonely.

Tifa nods. Suddenly the airship starts up.

**Tifa**  
Huh\!?

**Cloud**  
It's moving......

They run to the bridge. Cait Sith stands motionless in the corner, and they find Cid and Barret at the helm.

**Cloud**  
Barret\! Cid\!

**Barret**  
O, oh...... is that okay with you?

Nanaki bounds up from the stairs.

**Cloud**  
Nanaki\!

**Tifa**  
Why didn't you tell me\!?

**Nanaki**  
But, you know, Cid.

**Cid**  
Hey, Nanaki.  
If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later......

**Tifa**  
......Were you listening?

She runs off, embarrassed. Cloud turns away, scratching his head, and notices Vincent arriving.

**Cloud**  
Vincent\!

Everyone turns to look. Vincent turns away.

**Vincent**  
Why such a puzzled look?  
You don't want me to come?

**Cloud**  
No, it's just that you're always so cold. I thought you didn't care what was happening.

**Vincent**  
Cool?  
Hmm...... I guess that's just how I am, sorry.

He jumps over to his usual spot.

A light flashes red.

**Barret**  
Well lookey-here. The Shinra Manager's come back.

**Cait Sith**  
Uh, excuse me but...  
I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get away......  
So some people in Midgar took me in.  
I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard\!

**Barret**  
I guess that's everyone.

**Nanaki**  
No, Yuffie's missing.

**Barret**  
She ain't gonna show up.  
'Least this time she didn't steal our materia. Guess we gotta be thankful for that.

Yuffie drops down from the ceiling and shakes her fist at him.

**Yuffie**  
How could you say that\!?  
I came all the way here after being seasick as a dog\!  
I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the best parts all to yourselves\!

**Cloud**  
Welcome back, Yuffie.

**Yuffie**  
Gee, Cloud...... that's so nice of you to say that. ......You sick?  
Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the hall...... waiting...... upp\! ......Urk\!

She runs out of the bridge.

**Cloud**  
Thanks everyone.

**Barret**  
We didn't come back for your spikey headed ass\!  
We came back for Marlene. Guess it's jes' my...... whatcha call, feelings or somethin'.  
I, uh I ain't got now words now......

**Nanaki**  
......Although she's not here, she left us a window of opportunity...

**Cid**  
We can't let it go like this.

**Cloud**  
......Aeris.  
She was smiling to the end.  
We have to do something, or that smile will just freeze like that.  
Let's all go together.  
Memories of Aeris......  
Although she should've returned to the planet by now, something stopped her and now she's stuck......  
We've got to let go of Aeris's memory.

**Cid**  
Has anyone here changed their mind?

**Cloud**  
I'm counting on you, Cid.

**Cid**  
Yeah, yeah......  
There are 2 levers here that've been buggin' me for a while now...  
Let me try them out.  
All right, so what should I do?  
You decide, Cloud.

**Cloud**  
This is our last battle.  
Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is...... Sephiroth\!  
So let's move out\!

Cid pulls the levers. Jets open up on the Highwind and it blasts off.

**Cloud**  
We're almost to the North Cave\! We're on our way, Sephiroth\!

**Cid**  
Man, I'm going to stick it to him\!

A warning sounds.

**Cloud**  
What is it, Cid?

**Cid**  
Errrrggh\! Some incredible force\! Losing... control......\!

Cid's crew runs onto the deck and joins him at the helm.

**Cid**  
Get the hell outta here, flunkies\! Didn't I tell you all to go home\!?

**Crew**  
Yes, sir. This is our home\!\!

**Cid**  
Oh ma--......stop trying to act so cool.  
All right, you jokers\! Hold me down with everything you got\!\!  
Geronimo\!\!

### Cosmo Canyon - Bugenhagen's Farewell

---

**Gatekeeper**

If Nanaki is not in the party:

Bugenhagen seems rather down ever since he returned from that trip.  
I'm worried something might happen to Bugenhagen now of all times...

If Nanaki is in the party:

Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from that last trip, he doesn't seem well.  
Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?

**Elder Bugah**  
Where is the Promised Land...? Maybe Bugenhagen knows.  
Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon...

**Kid in Nanaki's Room**  
He's finally come home, but Mr. Bugenhagen doesn't seem well...  
I want to hear Mr. Bugenhagen's talk with Nanaki like we used to do...

**Elder Hargo**  
I think Bugenhagen has foreseen it.  
About the planet... About Nanaki... And, about himself...  
But, Bugenhagen would never say that. All he says is 'Ho Ho Hoooo'...

In the living quarters next to the materia shop...

**Kid**  
What's wrong with Bugenhagen? Is he sick?

**Woman**  
No need to be sad, even if something should happen. Everything will return to the planet... Bugenhagen says so.  
Just the thought of something happening to Bugenhagen... worries me.

If Cloud visits the observatory without Nanaki, he finds Bugenhagen lying on the sofa.

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho...... Hoooo. You......?  
It's been a while... since I've been out. I think I must have... tired myself out a bit.  
Ahh...... don't tell Nanaki. He'll only worry...

If Nanaki is in the party, then once they enter the observatory, he runs ahead of the others.

**Nanaki**  
Grandfather\!\!

Cloud holds out a hand to stop the other party member and shakes his head. They leave Nanaki alone with Bugenhagen.

**Nanaki**  
Grandfather\!\!

**Bugenhagen**  
...Nanaki...? ...you're still...... here?

**Nanaki**  
I can't leave you like this, grandfather...\!  
It's the duty of my... Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people...

**Bugenhagen**  
...listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.  
If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley.  
Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's.  
Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life.  
It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley...  
What you will see will eventually become a part of life's dream.  
For my children...... And for your children......  
So please, Nanaki... Go with Cloud... And with your eyes... your ears...

**Nanaki**  
.........

**Bugenhagen**  
Ho Ho...... Hoooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all right.  
It's a wide world and you must go out and see it... You may even find your life's mate. You never know.

**Nanaki**  
Grandfather......

**Bugenhagen**  
Oh yes... take this along. I think it will look good on you now.  
Ho Ho......

He slumps back, and Nanaki jumps up, putting his forepaws on the sofa. Fade to black.

Cloud is waiting at the bonfire. He stands when Nanaki arrives.

**Cloud**  
Nanaki... Is Bugenhagen...?

**Nanaki**  
......  
Grandpa told me that he's going away again\!

**Cloud**  
Away...?

**Nanaki**  
It seems like he really liked that Airship.  
He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here\!  
He even gave me a gift, look\!

<div class="highlight">

Received "Limited Moon"\!

</div>

**Nanaki**  
Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back?  
Ha ha...... Grandpa sure is strange\! Haa... ha ha...... ha......

He shakes his head.

**Cloud**  
Hmm... So maybe we'll run into him again somewhere.

**Nanaki**  
Yeah... maybe...  
Thanks, Cloud......

Cloud shakes his head.

**Kid in Nanaki's Room**  
Nanaki, is it true that Mr. Bugenhagen left on a journey? Then that means he's better, right? He IS going to come back soon, right?

**Nanaki**  
......  
...Don't worry. Grandpa will come back floating, saying 'Ho Ho Hoooo' again...

**Kid in Nanaki's Room**  
Yea, that's right\! 'Ho Ho Hoooo'\!  
It's Ho Ho Hoooo\! Ho Ho Hoooo\!

**Gatekeeper**  
Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong...

### Nibelheim - Memories of a Nightmare

---

Returning to Tifa's house, if Cloud picks out the melody of FF7's main theme on her piano...

**Cloud**  
I've heard this melody somewhere before. Managed to play well...

**Tifa**  
I have the sheet music for that song.  
Huh? Wait a minute\! There's something inside the music sheet.

<div class="highlight">

Tifa,

what's happened to our town? Was it all an illusion, or just a dream? No, it was neither. I remember trying to get people out of the flames, but not having the strength... Burning with anger, I went to the reactor to kill Sephiroth.

But he was nowhere to be found. Instead, I found you, collapsed inside. I felt saving you was far more important than going after Sephiroth. There were several others that were still alive inside, but I was only able to save you.

As I was coming out of the reactor, Shinra troops were just arriving. I recall a scientist named Hojo was in charge. He ordered the troops to gather up everyone still alive for the experiment. I didn't know what type of experiment he was talking about, but I wasn't about to let them have my dearest student.

Putting you on my back, I headed down the mountain to the village. I used the Cure spell on you many times.

And started to head to Midgar to look for a doctor for you. I don't like that city, but my Cure spells weren't helping.

I decided to go to Midgar to find a doctor I could trust. I'm worried about you, but I can't settle down in one place for very long. Have you recovered fully? Are you well?

I wonder how many years have passed since then? I just got into town again, but I can't believe it... The whole town is back to normal, except for the strange beings with black clothes all around...

The town reeks of Shinra, but I won't go after them. You may think I'm running from them, but it's just that I don't want anything to do with Shinra anymore. Feels like time is running out.

I'm sure you'll find this letter. And this gift for you. It should come in handy. I can't even jump anymore. But I hope you continue to sharpen your skills and remember what I taught you.

To my most precious student, From Zangan

</div>

<div class="highlight">

Received "Final Heaven"

</div>

Tifa practices some moves, then stretches and nods to herself.

---

Entering the basement library of the Shinra mansion now triggers a flashback sequence...

<div class="highlight">

Cloud and Zack are floating in the Mako tanks in the mansion's basement. A man approaches carrying something.

**Man**  
Hey\! This is your food.

When he opens Zack's tank, Zack punches him and escapes. He opens the other tank, and Cloud falls to the floor in a pool of Mako. Zack retrieves the Buster Sword, then returns to help Cloud. He drags Cloud with him out through the gates of Nibelheim. Fade to black.

**Zack**  
Oh, here\!\!  
Put on this.  
It smells a little though don't complain.  
You look pretty good with that.  
Well......

The scene fades in; Zack and Cloud, now both wearing SOLDIER uniforms, are riding in the back of an old truck. Zack raps on the window to the cab of the truck.

**Zack**  
Yo\! Old guy\! We at Midgar yet?

**Driver**  
Shaddap\! You're lucky I even gave you a ride\!

Zack shakes his head and sits back down beside Cloud.

**Zack**  
What're you gonna do once we get to Midgar?

**Cloud**  
.........

**Zack**  
I know what I'm gonna do.  
I got a place I can crash for a while...  
No wait, the mother lives there, too...

He scratches his head.

Guess that's out...

**Cloud**  
.........

**Zack**  
Yep... gotta change my plans\!  
Hmm......  
No matter what I do, I need some money first...  
...Hey, wanna start a business? But what could we do?  
Hey, Cloud.  
Think there's anything I'd be good at?  
Hey old guy\!  
What do you think I'd be good at?

**Driver**  
What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya?  
Young folks should try everything\!  
You gotta pay your dues while you're young.  
Go out and look for what you really want.

**Zack**  
Try everything... That's easy for him to say...

He does squats for a minute.

HEY\!  
Of course\!  
I got a lot of brains and skill that other guys don't\!  
That settles it\!  
I'm gonna become a mercenary\!  
Yeah\! Thanks pops\!

**Driver**  
Hey... didn't you even hear a word I said?

**Zack**  
Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that.  
Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money.  
I'm gonna be rich\!  
So, Cloud? What are YOU gonna do?

**Driver**  
No, wait... you got it all wrong.

**Cloud**  
u... uhhh......

**Zack**  
Just kidding... I won't leave you hanging like that.

He crouches down next to Cloud.

...We're friends, right?  
Mercenaries, Cloud. That's what you an' me are gonna be.  
Understand, Cloud?

Some time later, they come to a cliff, Zack dragging Cloud with him. Gunfire sounds from behind them, and Zack runs off-screen to fight the soldiers. After a moment he comes running back, stopping by Cloud. The soldiers shoot him and he flies back. They shoot him again until he lies still, then turn to Cloud.

**Shinra Soldier**  
What do you want to do with him?

**Cloud**  
...Ah... ughhhh......

**Commander**  
...Forget it. Just leave him.

They walk off, leaving Cloud behind. It starts to rain. Cloud crawls slowly over to Zack's body. He takes up the Buster Sword and raises his arms up to the sky. Beyond the cliff lies the city of Midgar.

### The World - Before the End

#### [Kalm](#kalm)

#### [Junon](#junon)

#### [Icicle Inn](#icicle)

---

<span id="kalm"></span>At Kalm...

**Redhead**  
Hey, listen to me\! I heard the barrier protecting Sephiroth is gone\!  
But with Rufus dead, the Shinra troops don't know what to do. Heidegger and Scarlet don't have what it takes to lead the troops......  
I really thought something was finally going to get done, but everything's the same... not a damn thing's changed\!

**Old Man**  
Ah, youth... You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky's going to fall here?  
If Shinra, Inc was our last hope, and they've been beaten by terrorists...... Are we all going to die?

Inside the first house...

**Woman**  
Dear, can you believe it\!? They say that Shinra's gone under\!\!  
This world is coming to an end all because those terrorists called AVALANCHE stuck their noses in the wrong place\!

Inside the second house...

**Old Man**  
If something ever happened to President Rufus, That'd be the end of Shinra, Inc...... and the rest of the world, too.

Back outside...

**Man**  
The North Crater barrier's been demolished?  
So now's the time to defeat Sephiroth.

In the bar...

**Barkeeper**  
They say the remaining members of AVALANCHE broke Shinra's resistance and destroyed the Mako cannon at Midgar.  
What's going to happen to the world...?

**Person in Blue**  
I heard the remaining members of AVALANCHE smashed the Shinra troops at Midgar.  
Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it\!

<span id="kalmtraveler"></span>Inside the fourth house, if Cloud has the Guidebook from the Ghost Ship:

**Kalm Traveler**  
OH\! It's "Guidebook"\! Wanna trade it for this Underwater Materia?  
How about it?

**Cloud**  
\- Trade  
\- Don't trade

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Trade</span>

**Kalm Traveler**  
Ok then, it's a done deal\!

He goes over to retrieve the materia.

It's Underwater Materia. Go on, it's yours\!

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't trade</span>

I dunno......

</div>

If Cloud has the Desert Rose from defeating Ruby Weapon:

**Kalm Traveler**  
OH\! It's "Desert Rose"\! Wanna trade it for that Chocobo over there?  
How about it?

**Cloud**  
\- Trade

**Kalm Traveler**  
Ok then, it's a done deal\!

He snaps his fingers and a gold chocobo appears.

It's a Chocobo. Take it, it's yours\!

If Cloud has the Earth Harp from defeating Emerald Weapon:

**Kalm Traveler**  
OH\! It's the Earth Harp\! Wanna trade it for some Master Materia?  
I'm not bein' stingy either\! I'll give you all three of 'em\!  
How about it?

**Cloud**  
\- Trade

**Kalm Traveler**  
Ok then, it's a done deal\!  
It's a 3-piece Master Materia set... and it's all yours\!

Depending on what items Cloud has traded him already...

**Kalm Traveler**  
"\[item\]" and "\[item\]"... Will you guys look for them for me?  
Now if I can just get "\[item\]", I can start my journey...

Once Cloud has traded him all three items...

**Kalm Traveler**  
I guess it's time to go on a journey for the souls of my departed friends......

He walks out of the room.

<span id="junon"></span>In Upper Junon...

**Soldier on the Path to the Airport**  
I finally got orders to join the Great Sephiroth Plan. I even get to go on the Gelnika too...  
But, I'm just gonna ignore them. I wanna live to see the end of the world.  
If I'm lucky... There'll be a good place for me in the New World.

<span id="icicle"></span>At Icicle Inn...

**Little Girl 1**  
Once the barrier's gone, I can hear cries from beyond the mountain...

**Little Girl 2**  
A sad voice is getting louder every second\!  
The mountain must be crying. Is it hurt?

**Man in Thicket**  
A bright light hsattered the barrier at the crater\! What in the world's goin' on\!?

<span id="highwind"></span>Cloud and the others reach the Northern Crater. On the Highwind...

**Barret**  
Heh heh...... heh heh heh... Time's got a way of sneakin' up on ya, huh?  
I'm shakin' all over... Heh heh... I feel sick...

**Tifa**  
Hey, Cloud... Would you tell me 'It's all right'?

**Cloud**  
\- Say it cool  
\- Say it normal  
\- Don't say it

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Say it cool</span>

Cloud strikes a pose.

**Cloud**  
It's all right, Tifa.

**Tifa**  
Now I feel like things are really going to be all right.  
Thanks, Cloud.  
I'm all right. I'm not going to chicken out at the last minute.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Say it normal</span>

**Cloud**  
...It's all right.

**Tifa**  
You're right, things will be all right.  
I'm... all right... really... I'll fight my hardest...

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Don't say it</span>

**Cloud**  
...I just can't say it that easy.

**Tifa**  
I'm sorry... I guess you're right.  
......Wow. I guess... I am a little scared. My knees are trembling.

</div>

**Nanaki**  
I am Nanaki, son of Seto... I am afraid of nothing...  
It's all right, all right. I'm Nanaki, the son of brave Seto... I'm not afraid of Sephiroth...

**Cait Sith**  
But I ain't gonna forget, no matter what happens.  
Not about this here trip, or them folks--none of it\!

**Vincent**  
Cloud...... take the ship to the Northern Cave.  
The time for flying is now past.  
Our battlefield is now beneath the earth...  
The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the darkness of the depths of the earth......

**Cid**  
You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?

**Cloud**  
\- No  
\- Yes

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">No</span>

**Cid**  
Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays.

</div>

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">Yes</span>

**Cid**  
Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.  
They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.  
An' I remember seein' it just once...  
That was when I was in Midgar interviewing to be a pilot.  
I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.  
Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.  
But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.  
Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up tellin' me my snorin' was too loud.  
So about all I really remember of that play is the end...  
The sister of the lead asks her lover,  
Do you really have to leave?  
And the guy says,  
I promised. The people I love, are waiting.  
......I don't understand. Not at all. But...... please take care of yourself.  
Of course... I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to wait. I'll return knowing that you'll be here.  
I remember thinking when I heard those lines,  
\*&%\! What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know... now I'm not so sure...  
I think I understand......

</div>

**Cid**  
When this job's done, I'm landing the ship... yeah, that's what I'll do.

**Yuffie**  
Cloud...... sign this.

**Cloud**  
What is it?

**Yuffie**  
It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the materia will belong to me.  
It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all right?

**Cloud**  
Forget it, I'm not even gonna read it.  
Whenever I read, I get airsick.

**Yuffie**  
Oh yeah......?  
I'm the same way, so I can't say too much......  
Damn\! My plan failed. Let's pick on Nanaki later to let off steam.

**Full Fledged Pilot**  
Cloud, what do you want to do?  
\- Go on  
\- Wait a minute

**Crew Member**  
I wonder what everyone's going to do when this fight's over?  
I wonder what's gonna happen to the Highwind...?

Cloud heads out to the deck.

**Crew Member**  
Take care\!

If Cloud leaves the Highwind and then returns:

**Crew Member**  
Welcome\! Everyone's waiting for you.

<span id="descent"></span>Cloud and the others start down into the Northern Cavern.

**Cloud**  
Looks like we can only slide down.  
\- Alright, let's go\!  
\- We'll get prepared first

They slide down and begin their descent into the crater. At length they come to a fork in the path.

**Cloud**  
The road splits into two. We'll split into two groups.

**Cid**  
Which you gonna choose, Cloud?

**Cloud**  
\- Left  
\- Right

**Barret**  
All right. Then I'll go...

**Tifa**  
Then I'm going...

**Nanaki**  
All right, then I'll go...

**Yuffie**  
I'm going......

**Cait Sith**  
Then I'll be heading...

**Vincent**  
Then, I will be going......

**Cid**  
All right\! I'm headin'...

**Cloud**  
Now don't any of you die on me.......  
Gotta get through to Sephiroth\!

The others split up according to Cloud's direction, and the characters not chosen for the party run off first.

> **Cid**  
> I'll destroy that Sephiroth before anyone gets to him\!
>
> He runs off.
>
> **Vincent**  
> It's all over now. With this...
>
> He runs off.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Oh man... 'Materia Hunter Yuffie' sounds like the last chapter of 'Materia Forever.'
>
> She runs off.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> All life on this planet, indeed the very life of this planet is in our hands...
>
> He runs off.
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> I'm so happy to have met you all, really\! ...sniff...
>
> He runs off.
>
> **Barret**  
> Well...... Looks like this is our last big job\!
>
> He runs off.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Let's all go back alive, okay?
>
> She runs off.

**Cloud**  
This will be the end of it\!

If Cloud attempts to go down the path he didn't choose, he will stop and say:

**Cloud**  
We'll leave this to \[name\].

Or, if he sent no one down that path:

We'll try to go down from the other side.

Cloud and his chosen party head off down one path.

<div class="block">

<span class="highlight">If they go left, they come to another fork.</span>

**Cloud**  
Another fork in the road...

> **Barret**  
> Cloud which way you gonna choose?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Cloud which way should we go?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Which way are we headed, Cloud?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> Cloud, which way you goin'?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Cloud, what shall we do?
>
> **Vincent**  
> What now, Cloud...?
>
> **Cid**  
> Which way you gonna go Cloud?

**Barret**  
All right, I'm goin'...

**Tifa**  
Then I'll go...

**Nanaki**  
All right, then I'm going...

**Yuffie**  
I'm goin'...

**Cait Sith**  
Then, I'll be heading...

**Vincent**  
If so, I will be going...

**Cid**  
All right\! I'm heading...

They choose directions again, and those not chosen for the party run off first.

> **Cid**  
> Sephiroth's probably crapping his pants right about now...
>
> **Vincent**  
> Let's go...
>
> **Yuffie**  
> If I knew THIS was gonna happen, I'd have bailed out sooner\!
>
> **Nanaki**  
> We're not the only ones fighting.  
> The planet's fighting too\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> There's nothing to worry about. ALL of us are in this together\!
>
> **Barret**  
> Ain't no way I'm gonna die until I stick this into that guy.
>
> **Tifa**  
> After this, we can go home. All of us...

**Cloud**  
Wait\! Sephiroth...

Cloud and his party continue on and at last reach a ledge very close to the bottom of the crater just ahead of the others. If he tries to go back up the other path...

**Cloud**  
Where's \[name\] and the others...?

</div>

Before Cloud can reach the very bottom, those sent down other paths appear.

> **Barret**  
> Yo, we're a bit late?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Hey, were you thinking of leaving me?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Don't leave us, Cloud.
>
> **Yuffie**  
> I finally got here, so I'm not leaving...
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> You're so cruel, Cloud.
>
> **Vincent**  
> You sure are hasty.
>
> **Cid**  
> I can't let you guys go by yourselves, you'll make me worry.

Everyone gathers overlooking the final descent.

**Cloud**  
This is the center of the Planet...?

Each member of the group which went down the opposite path has had something for Cloud...

> **Barret**  
> Here, Cloud.
>
> **Tifa**  
> Cloud, look.
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Cloud, I found this...
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> Hey, Cloud, I found this.
>
> **Vincent**  
> Hold on to this.
>
> **Cid**  
> Hey, Cloud, I found this on the way.

**Yuffie**  
......... Wh... What?

If at least one other party member accompanied Yuffie on the way down...

> **Barret**  
> Oh yeah, Yuffie, didn't you find somethin'?
>
> **Tifa**  
> By the way Yuffie didn't you find something?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> By the way Yuffie, didn't you find something on the way?
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> By the way, Yuffie, didn't you pick up something...
>
> **Vincent**  
> Yuffie, just let Cloud have it.
>
> **Cid**  
> Yeah, Yuffie, didn't you pick up something on the way?

**Yuffie**  
Oh, all right.  
Here, Cloud.

<div class="highlight">

Received "Last Elixir"\!

</div>

**Yuffie**  
But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me when you're done with it\!

**Barret**  
Awright, this's the last dance\!

**Tifa**  
This is it.

**Nanaki**  
We finally made it here.

**Yuffie**  
It feels like we made it as far as we can.

**Cait Sith**  
Well, shall we get goin'?

**Vincent**  
Hmm... Being with you all is not so bad.

**Cid**  
Let's just get this over with\!

**Cloud**  
\- Let's get going  
\- (No, not yet...)

**Cloud**  
All right, everyone, let's mosey.

**Cid**  
Damn\! Again\!  
Stop sayin' it like a wimp\!  
Can't you say 'Move out\!' or somethin'?

Cloud scratches his head.

**Cloud**  
Move out\!\!

There are growling and hissing noises from above them.

**Barret**  
What?

**Nanaki**  
Look at the number...

**Cid**  
%\#@^\! They're comin' out in full force\!

**Barret**  
Cloud\! You go first\!

**Cloud**  
I'm fighting here too.

**Barret**  
Shu'up\! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here\!

**Cid**  
Barret's right.  
You take two of us with you and go first. The rest'll catch up with ya later.

**Tifa**  
Is this like a practice run before the real thing?

**Cait Sith**  
Yeah, a major practice run...

**Yuffie**  
Heh heh, I'm fine with that. (It's probably more fun than fighting Sephiroth down there.)

**Vincent**  
Hmm, this might be fun to pass time.

The growling gets louder.

**Nanaki**  
They're coming\! They're already on the floor next to us\!

**Barret**  
Cloud\! Hurry up and make up your mind\!

**Cloud**  
All of you\!  
Later\!

> **Barret**  
> Yeah, later.
>
> **Tifa**  
> We'll meet up later.
>
> **Cid**  
> Yup\! Later\!

Cloud and his chosen party begin the final descent into the Planet's core. After several battles, they reach another platform farther down and look around.

**Cloud**  
Where are we...?

There is a screeching noise.

> **Barret**  
> What's that\!?
>
> **Tifa**  
> What\!?
>
> **Nanaki**  
> Wha... what\!?
>
> **Yuffie**  
> What\! What\!
>
> **Cait Sith**  
> What\!
>
> **Vincent**  
> What's this...\!?
>
> **Cid**  
> What the hell\!

Jenova∙SYNTHESIS appears from below.

**Cloud**  
Jenova...\!?  
It's coming\!\!

A battle with Jenova ensues. After they defeat her, the ground beneath them breaks apart and they fall downwards into a bright green light. The screen goes white. Cloud floats towards a bright white light pulsing in the darkness.

**Cloud**  
Li...... ight......  
A light...  
Is this......  
Is this light...... Holy?

<span id="sephiroth"></span>Everyone comes to on stone platforms surrounding a caged Holy, including those who stayed behind to hold off the monsters.

> **Barret**  
> Oww... damn, man\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> Owwww......
>
> **Cid**  
> Owww......

**Cloud**  
Barret\!? | Tifa\!? | Cid\!?

> **Barret**  
> What...? So everyone's together again...?
>
> **Tifa**  
> Cloud...... Cloud... So we did end up together...
>
> **Cid**  
> Goddammit... So we're all here...?

A pulse of energy goes through them all, lifting them into the air.

**Everyone**  
Uuuugh...\!\!

Sephiroth appears in front of Holy.

**Cloud**  
...Sephiroth\!\!

Another pulse of energy.

**Barret**  
Ugh...\! Is this...... the true power of Sephiroth?

**Cid**  
My... my body... I can't control my body...... Uuugh\!?

Another pulse.

**Nanaki**  
My front legs...... my hind legs...... my tail's about to tear off\!\!

**Cait Sith**  
This is definitely not good...... He's way outta our league...

**Yuffie**  
I, I don't know if I can... go on...

A sharper pulse, and they all double over.

**Tifa**  
Cloud... Cloud...

**Cloud**  
Ugh... ugh...

Another pulse, and Cloud stops writhing.

**Cloud**  
...there...  
It's...... there...

**Tifa**  
Cloud...?

**Cloud**  
...Holy...... Holy... is there......  
The Holy is shining......  
Aeris's prayer is shining......\!

**Tifa**  
Holy...... Aeris......

**Cloud**  
It's not over yet... This isn't the end yet\!\!

They prepare themselves for battle.

**Cloud**  
\- Let's go everyone...\!  
\- Just one more time...\!

One final pulse.

**Everyone**  
Eeeyaaaa----\!\!

Or:

Uuuuuuuaaaaaaagh\!\!

> **Barret**  
> Urrrrrgh\!\!  
> Not only Aeris...  
> Holy is the prayer of AVALANCHE...of Marlene and Dyne... And everyone on the planet\!
>
> **Tifa**  
> ...We're not gonna lose\!\!  
> Aeris is here... everyone is here... Cloud is here with us\!

> I'm going to see it through to the end. For our future... And that of the planet...  
> I understand now, Grandpa. This is my mission\!

>
> **Yuffie**  
> I don't like it\!\!  
> Maybe... maybe I shouldn't have come...  
> I don't need... materia...... any...  
> Nope, I still want it\!\! This an' that an' everything... MINE\! And I'm never gonna give any up\!\!

> **Cait Sith**  
> We're not losin'\!\!  
> Maybe we were a little late in noticing the trouble that we were getting into...  
> But, there's still time... We should still be able to get out of it\! Even if we can't get EVERYTHING back to normal\!

> **Vincent**  
> Damn...\!

> Sephiroth, now it's your time to sleep between the ages\!\!
>
> **Cid**  
> This ain't nothin'\!\!  
> Hoo-ok......\! I can't be foolin' around in the bottom of this hell hole...  
> I still have lots of stuff to do with my life\!

**Cloud**  
Aeris's memories... Our memories...  
We came... to tell you... our memories... Come Planet\! Show us your answer\!  
And Sephiroth\!\! To the settling of everything\!\!

They fight first Bizarro∙Sephiroth and then Safer∙Sephiroth, and after a long battle, they emerge victorious. Everyone gathers again on the ledge above the final descent into the Planet's core.

**Cloud**  
This is all we could do.

**Barret**  
Wait\! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?

**Cloud**  
That... I don't know. Isn't the rest up to the Planet?

**Tifa**  
...You're right.  
We've done all that we could do.

**Cloud**  
All right, everyone.  
It's no use thinking about it.  
We'll leave all our worries here.  
Let's go home proud.

They all start up the path, with Cloud and Tifa the last to go. A flash of white, and Cloud stops. Tifa turns back to him.

**Tifa**  
What happened?

**Cloud**  
......I feel it...

**Tifa**  
What......

Another flash.

**Cloud**  
He is still...... here.

Cloud clutches his head.

**Cloud**  
Still......

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!?

**Cloud**  
He's... laughing...

Cloud's spirit appears to pull away as his body collapses. The screen goes white.

**Tifa**  
Cloud\!

<span id="end"></span>Cloud travels along a long tunnel to find Sephiroth waiting for him at the end of it. They duel one-on-one, and Cloud wins. Sephiroth, a shocked look on his face, dissolves into the Lifestream. The Lifestream then rises up and surrounds Cloud.

**Cloud**  
.........Lifestream?

He holds out his hand, seeing a bare hand reaching down for him. But, once he comes to, he sees that it's Tifa's hand, and the ground is crumbling beneath his feet. The rock gives way beneath Tifa, but Cloud catches her and manages to grab hold of the ledge.

**Cloud**  
......I think I'm beginning to understand.

**Tifa**  
What?

**Cloud**  
An answer from the Planet...  
the Promised Land...  
I think I can meet her...there.

Tifa hesitates, and then she closes her eyes and leans her head against Cloud.

**Tifa**  
Yeah, let's go meet her.

Cloud helps Tifa up to the ledge, and they pull themselves up.

**Cloud**  
Hey, where is everyone?

They both turn to look at the ledge across from them, where the others are gathered.

**Barret**  
Heeeey\!

**Tifa** (waving)  
I'm glad you're all safe\!

**Barret** (turning to Cid)  
They all seem to be safe, too.  
But...now what're we going to do?

**Nanaki**  
Holy should be moving soon,  
and that means this place will...

**Cid**  
Oh, Lady Luck don't fail me now...

As Cid looks up, his mouth drops open and his cigarette falls from it. Everyone looks up to watch the Highwind come crashing down, Lady Luck painted on its side. Once they are all on board, Holy bursts from the crater, propelling them ahead of it. The Highwind starts coming apart.

**Cid**  
Shit\!\!

Cid reaches for an emergency lever and pulls it. The Highwind transforms into a plane and flies away from the crater.

Meanwhile, in a house in Kalm, Marlene looks up from where she is sitting at a table.

**Marlene**  
The flower girl?

Going to the window, she looks west towards Midgar. Meteor is bearing down on the city, a violent storm beneath it tearing apart the upper plate. Holy rushes in from the north and forms a shield between Meteor and Midgar, but Meteor pushes through.

Back on the Highwind...

**Barret**  
Wait a damn minute\!  
What's going to happen to Midgar?  
We can't let that happen\!

**Cait Sith**  
I had everyone take refuge in the slums,  
but the way things are now...

**Nanaki**  
It's too late for Holy.  
Meteor is approaching the Planet.  
Holy is having the opposite effect.  
Forget Midgar,  
we've gotta worry about the Planet.

They stand around anxiously, watching helplessly. Suddenly, Tifa spots something.

**Tifa**  
What's that\!?

They all turn to look as tendrils of the Lifestream come up out of the earth.

**Barret**  
What the hell IS that......?

**Cloud**  
......Lifestream.

As more of the Lifestream comes up, the people of Kalm sense something and open up their windows to look.

**Marlene**  
It's coming.

The Lifestream converges on Midgar. A blinding light flashes over the Planet, and everyone flinches. And, somewhere, Aeris lifts her head and smiles.

Five hundred years later

Nanaki, his mane bedecked now with eight feathers, is running through a canyon with two cubs trailing behind him. He leads them up to the top of a rise, and the three of them look down upon Midgar, which is by now overrun with vibrant green vegetation.
