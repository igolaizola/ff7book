# Chapter 1: The Bombing Mission

The stars, a silent, swirling multitude, hummed a soft, distant song. Slowly, the cosmic vista drifted, giving way to a young woman’s face, bathed in the ethereal, sickly green glow of Mako energy. Aeris. She rose, the light clinging to her like a shroud, and walked out into the grimy streets of Midgar. The camera, an unseen eye, pulled back, revealing the city in its entirety – a monstrous pizza of steel and squalor, eight Mako reactors ringing its perimeter like malevolent watchtowers. Then, it plunged downwards, a hawk sighting prey, latching onto a train as it screeched into a Sector 8 station.

The carriage doors hissed open. Biggs and Jessie, wiry and quick, leaped out first, their movements economical as they neutralized the two Shinra guards stationed on the platform. Wedge, heavier but no less determined, followed, the trio vanishing into the gloom of the industrial sector. Finally, Barret Wallace, a mountain of a man with a gun grafted onto his right arm, landed with a thud that seemed to shake the very foundations of the station. Cloud Strife, slighter, with a shock of spiky blond hair and an oversized sword strapped to his back, dropped down last, his landing quiet, almost predatory.

"C'mon newcomer. Follow me," Barret grunted, his voice a low rumble that suited his frame. He charged ahead, a force of nature.

Cloud followed, his movements fluid and practiced. Two more Shinra guards, alerted by the commotion, rushed him. A flash of steel, a grunt, and they were down, dispatched with a chilling efficiency that spoke of extensive training. He rejoined the others at a heavy blast door leading to the No. 1 Mako Reactor complex. Jessie, her fingers flying over a control panel, was already working to bypass the lock.

"Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right!" Biggs exclaimed, his eyes wide with a mixture of awe and apprehension. SOLDIER. Shinra’s elite. Their very presence here, working with AVALANCHE, was an anomaly. "Not everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE."

Jessie glanced up from her work, her brow furrowed. "SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy? What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?" The question hung in the Mako-tinged air, heavy with suspicion.

"Hold it, Jessie," Biggs interjected, a hand on her shoulder. "He _was_ in SOLDIER. He quit them and now is one of us." He turned back to Cloud. "Didn't catch your name..."

Cloud’s gaze remained distant, his eyes, the color of the Lifestream itself, betraying nothing. "...Cloud."

"Cloud, eh? I'm—"

"I don't care what your names are," Cloud cut him off, his voice flat, devoid of emotion. "Once this job's over... I'm outta here." It was a statement of fact, not a threat. He was a mercenary, here for the gil, nothing more. The planet, its struggles, AVALANCHE’s cause – they were background noise to the turmoil that sometimes echoed in his own mind.

Barret stormed back, his gun-arm glinting ominously. "The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a group! Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge in front of it."

The blast door hissed open under Jessie's ministrations. She, Biggs, and Wedge scrambled through. Barret, however, turned back to Cloud, his face a mask of suspicion. "Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!" He jabbed a thumb towards the controls. "If you push the Directional button while pushing the cancel button, you can run." With that cryptic piece of advice, he lumbered after the others.

Cloud glanced up at the looming Mako reactor, its pipes and vents exhaling a foul, metallic breath. It was a monument to Shinra's insatiable hunger, a steel maw devouring the very lifeblood of the Planet. He’d heard AVALANCHE’s rhetoric – the Lifestream, Mako, the dying Planet. It meant little to him. This was a job. He adjusted the Buster Sword on his back, the familiar weight a cold comfort, and followed.

On the bridge before the reactor, Wedge peeled off. "I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the mission, Cloud." He grinned, a nervous energy about him. "Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace up? This'll be somethin' to see!"

Cloud merely nodded and proceeded into the reactor with Barret, Biggs, and Jessie. The air inside was thick with the cloying scent of Mako, its sickly green luminescence bathing everything in an unnatural glow.

"Yo! This your first time in a reactor?" Barret's voice boomed, echoing off the metallic walls.

"No," Cloud replied, his tone clipped. "After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know."

"The planet's full of Mako energy," Barret began, his voice taking on a preacher’s fervor. "People here use it every day." Cloud offered a noncommittal shrug. "It's the lifeblood of this planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines."

"I'm not here for a lecture," Cloud said, cutting him short. "Let's just hurry."

Barret’s eyes narrowed. "That's it! You're comin' with me from now on."

Jessie, ever the technician, chimed in, "Biggs and I got the code for this door."

"Code deciphered," Biggs confirmed a moment later. The first door slid open. "Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this code..." His voice was somber, a reminder of the stakes.

Jessie got to work on the next door. "Code deciphered."

The second door opened, revealing an elevator. Jessie, Cloud, and Barret stepped inside. "Push that button over there!" Jessie instructed Cloud.

He complied, the button clicking softly under his touch. The elevator began its descent into the reactor's depths.

"Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life," Barret continued, his voice heavy with conviction. "And that'll be that."

"It's not my problem," Cloud stated, his gaze fixed on the descending numbers.

Barret’s fist clenched. "The planet's dyin', Cloud!"

"The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before security and the Roboguards come."

The elevator reached the bottom. They stepped out onto a gantry overlooking the reactor core, a monstrous, pulsating heart of Mako energy. Jessie hung back as Barret and Cloud proceeded down a set of stairs. "Push the OK button in front of a ladder to grab on to it," she called after them. "After that, use the Directional button to move up and down."

They descended further, the air growing colder, the Mako hum more intense. Finally, they stood before the core itself.

"When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk," Barret said, a grim satisfaction in his voice. "Cloud, you set the bomb."

Cloud hesitated. "Shouldn't you do it?"

"Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'."

"Fine, be my guest." Cloud knelt, retrieving the explosive device from his pack. As his fingers brushed against the cold metal casing, a wave of dizziness washed over him. The world tilted, stained crimson. A sharp, keening hum filled his ears, drowning out the reactor’s thrum. He felt himself rising, on tiptoe, an unseen force pulling him.

_Watch out!_ The voice, urgent, disembodied, screamed in his mind. _This isn't just a reactor!!_

The vision vanished as quickly as it came, leaving him disoriented, a cold sweat on his brow.

"...What's wrong?" Barret’s gruff voice cut through the lingering hum.

Cloud blinked, shaking his head to clear it. "Huh?"

"What's wrong, Cloud? Hurry it up!"

"...Yeah, sorry." He pushed the unsettling experience aside and focused on the task. The bomb clicked into place. Immediately, klaxons blared, red lights flashing across the chamber.

"Heads up, here they come!" Barret roared, his gun-arm already spitting fire.

A massive, scorpion-like machine, a Guard Scorpion, scuttled into view, its metallic claws snapping.

"Barret, be careful!" Cloud shouted over the din, his SOLDIER instincts taking over. "Attack while its tail's up! It's gonna counterattack with its laser."

The battle was fierce. The Guard Scorpion was heavily armored, its laser cannon a constant threat. But Cloud and Barret, despite their animosity, fought with a grim synchronicity. Cloud’s Buster Sword, a ridiculously large weapon for anyone not imbued with Mako-enhanced strength, whirled and crashed against the machine’s chassis, while Barret’s gun-arm laid down a suppressing barrage. Finally, with a screech of tearing metal and a gout of black smoke, the Guard Scorpion collapsed.

"Come on, let's get outta here!" Cloud yelled. A synthesized voice echoed through the reactor: _Ten minutes to detonation!_

They scrambled back the way they came. Cloud found Jessie near the gantry, her foot caught in a mangled piece of grating. He quickly knelt beside her.

"You all right?"

"My leg got stuck." Her voice was tight with pain, but she managed a grateful smile as he worked her foot free. "Thanks!" She leaped over him, already running.

Cloud followed her back up the elevator. Biggs was waiting. "Let's go!"

Jessie, despite her injury, was a blur of motion at the door controls. "Code deciphered." The first door opened. "Alright, be careful." "Code deciphered." The second door hissed open.

They burst out of the reactor building and across the bridge, Wedge waiting at the exit. Barret, in his haste, accidentally bowled Jessie over. Cloud instinctively reached down, helping her up. They scrambled through the final doorway just as the No. 1 Mako Reactor erupted behind them in a blinding flash and a deafening roar that shook the very ground beneath their feet. The shockwave buffeted them, a hot, acrid wind carrying the taste of destruction.

---

In the designated escape passage, their exit was blocked by a fresh fall of rubble, a consequence of their handiwork. Jessie, limping but resolute, was already setting another, smaller explosive charge.

"That should keep the planet going... at least a little longer," Biggs murmured, his voice a mixture of grim satisfaction and weariness.

"Yeah," Wedge agreed, though his eyes still held a trace of the awe he’d expressed earlier.

Barret remained silent, his massive frame tense, staring at the newly sealed passage.

"OK! Now everyone get back," Jessie called, her work complete.

The smaller bomb detonated, blasting a hole through the rubble. One by one, they leaped through, Wedge stumbling and rolling as if he were on fire for a moment before regaining his composure.

"All right, now let's get out of here," Barret commanded, his voice regaining its usual force. "Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!"

Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie nodded and scattered in separate directions, melting into the shadows of the ruined sector. Barret started to follow.

"H, hey!" Cloud called out.

Barret paused. "If it's about your money… Save it 'til we're back at the hideout." He, too, disappeared, leaving Cloud alone.

The mercenary sighed. He was used to working alone, preferred it even. He made his way through the debris-strewn streets, the air thick with the smell of burnt Mako and fear. In a deserted city square, a place that might once have held a semblance of life, he saw a flower girl. She was young, her dress simple, a basket of surprisingly vibrant flowers clutched in her hand. As panicked citizens, late to flee the area of the explosion, rushed past, one of them knocked her down. She picked herself up, dusting off her dress with a quiet dignity that seemed out of place in the surrounding chaos. Then, her eyes met Cloud’s, and she walked over to him.

"Excuse me," she said, her voice soft but clear. "What happened?"

Cloud hesitated. Part of him wanted to brush her off, to maintain the detached mercenary persona. But something in her gaze, an unexpected resilience, a hint of an ancient sorrow, stayed his tongue.

"You'd better get out of here," he found himself saying, the words rougher than he intended.

"Really?" she asked, a slight frown creasing her brow. "I don't know what's going on, but all right." She turned to leave.

"Hey, listen..." Cloud said, almost surprising himself. She stopped. He looked at the flowers in her basket, a splash of defiant color in the grey, polluted world of the slums where such things rarely grew. "Don't see many flowers around here."

A small smile touched her lips. "Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only a gil...?"

He reached into his pocket. "Buy one."

Her smile widened, a genuine, luminous thing. "Oh, thank you! Here you are!" She carefully selected a single yellow flower and handed it to him.

Cloud took it, the delicate petals a strange contrast to his calloused, sword-wielding hand. He wasn't sure why he'd bought it. Maybe it was a fleeting impulse, a momentary crack in the armor he wore so carefully.

The flower girl walked away, disappearing into the panicked crowds. Cloud, the solitary bloom tucked into his gear, continued his journey through the ravaged Sector 8. The graffiti of AVALANCHE was everywhere, a stark reminder of their desperate war against Shinra: "Don't be fooled by Shinra! Mako energy doesn't last forever! Mako is the planet's lifesource! The end is in sight! Protectors of the planet: AVALANCHE."

He eventually reached an intersection, the railway tracks running through a tunnel beneath the street.

"Hey! You there!!"

Shinra soldiers. Cloud suppressed a groan. He had no time for this. He could fight them, or…

Before he could decide, more soldiers swarmed from another direction, then another, quickly surrounding him above the railway tunnel.

"That's as far as you go," one of them sneered.

"I don't have time to be messin' around with you guys," Cloud retorted, his hand instinctively going to the hilt of the Buster Sword.

"Enough babbling...... Grab him!!"

As the soldiers lunged, Cloud acted. With a powerful leap, he vaulted over the railing, dropping with impossible grace onto the roof of a train as it roared out of the tunnel below. The wind whipped at his hair as he braced himself, Midgar's upper plate a distant, oppressive ceiling against the perpetually dark sky.

---

Inside the train's baggage car, Barret, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie were gathered, the mood somber.

"Cloud never came," Wedge said, his voice small.

Biggs sighed. "Cloud...... Wonder if he was killed?"

"No way!!" Barret slammed his fist against a nearby crate, the sound echoing in the confined space.

Jessie looked down, her expression troubled. "Cloud......"

A sudden drumming on the roof made them all jump. Biggs exchanged a hopeful glance with Barret. "Say, do you think Cloud's...... Going to fight to the end for AVALANCHE!?"

Barret snorted. "The hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader?" He pounded the crate again. "Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups..."

Wedge flinched. "Hey, Barret! What about our money...?" Another bang on the crate cut him off. "Uh, nothin' ...sorry."

A muffled shout from outside, "Ahhh......", followed by louder banging on the roof. The baggage car door slid open, and Cloud swung through, landing lightly on his feet.

"Cloud!!" Biggs, Jessie, and Wedge exclaimed in unison, relief washing over their faces.

"Looks like I'm a little late," Cloud said, his voice even.

Barret rounded on him. "You damn right, you're late!! Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!"

Cloud shrugged. "It's no big deal. Just what I always do."

"Shi't!" Barret fumed. "Havin' everyone worried like that… you don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!"

A faint smirk touched Cloud’s lips. "Hmm...... You were worried about me!"

"Wha!?" Barret sputtered, then regained his composure. "I'm takin' it outta your money, hot stuff! Wake up! We're movin' out! Follow me!" He stormed off into the next car.

Wedge grinned at Cloud. "Hey, Cloud!! You were great back there!" He followed Barret.

Biggs clapped Cloud on the shoulder. "Heh heh...... Cloud! We'll do even better next time." He too disappeared, leaving Cloud alone with Jessie.

Jessie walked to the open door. "Be careful, I'll shut this." She closed it and turned to Cloud, her eyes appraising him. "Oh, Cloud!! Your face is pitch-black......" She reached up, gently rubbing the soot from his cheek. "There you go! Say, thanks for helping me back there at the Reactor!" With a final smile, she slipped into the next car.

Cloud followed, finding himself in a passenger car. The announcement system crackled to life: _Last train out of Sector 8 Station. Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard. Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM, Midgar Standard Time..._

The other AVALANCHE members were already there, their presence causing other passengers to hastily vacate the car. A Shinra manager muttered, "This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy..." while a disheveled man, clearly a regular on this late-night run, declared, "Huh...? This is my house, so make yourselves at home."

A bald man, clutching a copy of the Shinra Times, leaned towards Cloud. "You see the headlines? The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums. ...blowing up a Reactor... they sure put some thought into this one. They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?"

Barret, overhearing, scowled. "Stop actin' like a damn kid. Si'down an' shu'up!"

Biggs yawned. "It seems this train hasn't switched to security mode yet. I'm sure that will change by tomorrow. ...YAWN... that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station."

Wedge, ever optimistic, bounced on the balls of his feet. "Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous... and me, too! Cloud!! Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?"

Cloud considered him. "What do you have in mind?"

"All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick," Wedge confessed. "But after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things."

Jessie beckoned Cloud over to a monitor displaying a map of the Midgar Rail System. "Hey, Cloud. You want to look at this with me? I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors... you know, flashy stuff." The monitor flickered, showing a 3D model of Midgar. "This is a complete model of the city of Midgar. It's about a 1/10000 scale. The top plate is about 50 meters above ground. A main support structure holds the plate up in the center, and there are other support structures built in each section..." She leaned in, lowering her voice. "Psst... whisper... whisper (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.) Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor. The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity. Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them. Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's the kind of place this is."

She switched the display. "Phew..., this is next! Look. This is the route this train is on. The route spirals around the main support structure. We should be coming around the center area, right now. At each checkpoint, an ID sensor device is set up. It can check the identities and backgrounds on each and every passenger on the train by linking it up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters." Again, she whispered, "Whisper... whisper... (Anyone could tell that we look suspicious, so we're using fake ID's.)"

As if on cue, a red light began to flash. "Speak of the devil..." Jessie murmured. "That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area. ...whisper... whisper... (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.) ...anyhow, we're almost back now. That's a relief."

The lights stopped flashing. Wedge, who had been cowering, sighed. "I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark."

Jessie patted his arm. "I know! Next time, I'll give you one I made myself." She turned to Cloud. "Looking forward to it?"

Cloud managed a slight nod. "Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG," Jessie promised, her eyes sparkling. "We're almost there. After talking with you, I really want to do it! I think you've lit my fuse!"

Biggs snored softly nearby, muttering in his sleep, "Don't act so damn big, Barret... snooze..."

Barret, oblivious, stared out the window. "Look... you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night. If that plate weren't there... we could see the sky."

Cloud joined him, the yellow flower a small, bright speck against his dark uniform. The sight of the slums sprawled beneath the massive, oppressive plate always stirred a faint disquiet in him. "A floating city... Pretty unsettling scenery."

Barret grunted, surprised. "Huh? Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you. ...you jes' full of surprises." He gestured at the plate above. "The upper world... a city on a plate... It's 'cuz of that &^\#$\# 'pizza', that people underneath are sufferin'! And the city below is full of polluted air. On topa that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy."

"Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?" Cloud asked, the question more a statement of the obvious disparity than a genuine inquiry.

"Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe... 'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets."

Cloud’s gaze drifted back to the window. "I know... no one lives in the slums because they want to. It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it." The words, unexpectedly melancholic, hung in the air as the train rumbled on towards Sector 7.

<div id="chapter-2"></div>

# Chapter 2: Seventh Heaven's Hideout

The train shuddered to a halt at the Sector 7 station, its brakes hissing like an angry beast. Passengers, a motley collection of slum dwellers and weary late-night travelers, began to disembark into the grimy, Mako-stained air.

"Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!" Barret’s voice boomed across the platform. Cloud, who had started to wander off, paused. "Yo, Cloud! You lissen up!"

The AVALANCHE members – Cloud, Tifa, Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge – gathered around Barret at the steps leading down from the platform. The station was a study in decay, rust clinging to the metal supports, the air thick with the smell of refuse and unfulfilled dreams.

"This mission was a success," Barret declared, though his tone lacked its usual triumphant bluster. "But don't get lazy now. The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion! Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that! Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!"

With that, Barret charged off, Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie trailing in his wake. Cloud lingered for a moment, the station man, a figure as weathered as the station itself, catching his eye.

"When you've been a train man as long as I have," the old man mused, his voice raspy, "you see a lot of people and a lot of lives. People meeting, parting, joy, sadness... After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore." He sighed, a sound like dry leaves skittering across concrete. "I wonder how long it's been... There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers. I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way." He paused, his gaze distant. "That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again. Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then. But, that's a story for another day... First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am."

Cloud nodded curtly and left the station, stepping out into the chaotic streets of Sector 7. The slums were a labyrinth of makeshift shanties and crumbling tenements, all huddled beneath the oppressive shadow of the Sector 7 plate support pillar. A red-haired couple huddled near a flickering streetlamp, their whispered conversation barely audible above the general din.

"I'm not letting you go tonight," the young man murmured.

"Wow!" the girl breathed, her eyes wide.

"Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?"

"Wow! There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too!"

"......damn."

Further on, a man stood by a rickety fence, gazing up at the colossal support pillar. "Hey now!! Oops!!" he exclaimed as Cloud approached. "What on earth are you doing? Just butt out......geez! Huh? You came to see it, too?" He gestured upwards. "There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust... Well, there's no point in worryin' about that. Hey!! Look! It's huge, ain't it?" Cloud followed his gaze, the sheer scale of Shinra’s engineering a testament to their power, and their disregard for those living beneath. "Hey... This is a strange and wonderful place," the man continued. "This is my place, but you can come here when you want. Bye, bro!" He ran off, leaving Cloud alone with his thoughts.

The air here was even fouler than in Sector 8, heavy with pollutants and the ever-present tang of Mako. Flowers, like the one Aeris had given him, were a distant memory, choked out by the toxic environment. Shinra’s prosperity, built on the relentless draining of the Lifestream, had come at a steep price for those who lived in the shadows of the upper plate.

As Cloud neared a bar named "7th Heaven," he saw Barret and the others barge inside. A burst of gunfire – Barret's signature, no doubt – echoed out, followed by a stream of panicked customers. Tifa Lockhart, Cloud’s childhood friend, emerged, bowing apologetically to the fleeing patrons. She was a striking figure, her dark hair cascading over her shoulders, her sympathetic eyes a stark contrast to the rugged determination that Cloud knew lay beneath. She managed the bar, but it also served as AVALANCHE’s clandestine hideout.

Barret reappeared at the entrance, impatience etched on his face. "Heh heh... You wanna meet your little baby?"

Cloud frowned. "Little baby?"

Barret scoffed. "Hey! Don' act like you don't know what I mean! I'm tellin' you..."

Cloud brushed past him, ignoring the various slum dwellers who offered unsolicited news updates about the reactor bombing or bemoaned their current predicaments. He passed a crudely scrawled AVALANCHE sign – "Don't be taken in by the Shinra. Mako energy will not last forever. Mako is the life of the Planet and that life is finite. The end is coming. Saviors of the Planet: AVALANCHE." – his expression unreadable. The item shop was closed, but the weapons shop was open, though the proprietor seemed more interested in lecturing than selling.

Finally, Cloud entered 7th Heaven. The interior was cozy, if a little worn, a stark contrast to the squalor outside. A little girl with bright, inquisitive eyes – Marlene, Barret’s daughter – hopped up excitedly as he entered, then, recognizing him as a stranger, shyly ran to hide behind Tifa, who was wiping down the bar.

"Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to Cloud?" Tifa gently chided, then turned to Cloud, a warm smile gracing her lips. "Welcome home, Cloud. Looks like everything went well." Her gaze softened with a hint of concern. "Did you fight with Barret?"

"Yeah," Cloud admitted. It was an almost constant state of affairs.

Tifa sighed. "I should have known. He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little. I was worried." She noticed the flower tucked into his gear. "Flowers? How nice... You almost never see them here in the slums." Her eyes twinkled. "A flower for me? Oh Cloud, you shouldn't have..."

Cloud felt a flush creep up his neck. "No big," he mumbled. He held out the flower. "Give it to Tifa."

Her smile deepened. "Thank you, Cloud. It smells wonderful." She brought it to her nose, inhaling its faint fragrance. "Maybe I should fill the store with flowers." She tucked it carefully into a small vase behind the bar. "Sorry, Cloud. Marlene seems a little shy."

Marlene peeked out from behind Tifa, her eyes wide. "............"

Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie were slumped around a table, already nursing drinks. Biggs, clearly a few drinks in, slurred, "Aaah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job. Hic! Why don't you have one too?"

"No," Cloud declined.

Biggs bristled. "What!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me? Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!" He quickly glanced around. "Hic...! Oh...... Don't tell Barret what I just said."

Wedge, looking rounder than Cloud remembered, beamed. "Oh, Cloud! Tifa really knows how to cook. Mmm, mmm...... Anyway, let me tell you somethin'. Tifa always lets me taste her cooking. And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly. Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous."

Jessie, looking a little too pleased with herself, chimed in, "Careless...... You're getting all excited. Wonder what for......?"

Cloud started for the door leading to the basement hideout, but had to jump back as Barret thundered in, nearly knocking him over.

"Papa, welcome home!" Marlene cried, running to her father. Barret scooped her up, his gruff exterior melting away as he settled her on his shoulder. He spotted the flower Tifa had placed in the vase.

"Huh? Where'd you get that flower?" he asked Tifa.

"Cloud gave it to me," Tifa explained, a slight blush coloring her cheeks.

Barret grunted, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes, then addressed Marlene. "Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!" He headed for the basement, using a hidden elevator activated by the pinball machine in the corner. The others followed.

Cloud lingered for a moment. Tifa was still behind the bar, the usual warmth in her eyes now tinged with a quiet anxiety.

"Sit down," she said softly. Cloud complied. "How about... something to drink?"

"Give me something hard," he replied.

Tifa nodded, her movements graceful as she reached for a bottle. "Just a minute. I'll make one for you." She poured a measure of amber liquid into a glass. "You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely."

"What's with you all of a sudden? That wasn't even a tough job."

"I guess not..." She slid the drink across the bar. "You were in SOLDIER." A pause. "Make sure you get your pay from Barret."

Cloud took a sip, the strong spirit burning a welcome trail down his throat. "Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here."

He stood, ready to join the others. Tifa’s voice, soft but insistent, stopped him. "Cloud. Are you feeling all right?"

He met her gaze, a flicker of his own buried concerns momentarily surfacing. "...yeah... Why?"

"No reason. You just look a little tired I guess." Her eyes searched his, as if trying to read the secrets hidden behind his Mako-infused stare. "You'd better go down below."

Cloud nodded and descended into the AVALANCHE hideout. The basement was a cluttered but functional space. Jessie was hunched over a computer console, lines of code scrolling across the screen. Wedge sat at a table in the center of the room, looking nervous. Barret was pummelling a punching bag in the corner with his good arm, while Biggs and Marlene watched.

The television near Jessie’s computer flickered to life, showing footage of the bombed reactor. President Shinra, his face a mask of stern authority, was addressing the citizens of Midgar. "...today the No. 1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility... It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror. But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear. I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry..."

Jessie glanced up, a mixture of pride and apprehension on her face. "Oops... Hey, look at the news... What a blast. Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me." A flicker of doubt crossed her features. "Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere." Then, her pride returned. "Hey, that was my bomb's debut. Makes me kinda proud."

Barret stopped his assault on the punching bag and turned to Cloud. "Yo, Cloud! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya. Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?"

"None. I'm positive," Cloud stated.

Barret’s eyes narrowed. "You sound pretty sure."

"If there was anyone from SOLDIER, you wouldn't be standing here now." The words were cold, a blunt assessment of SOLDIER’s capabilities.

Barret bristled. "Don't you go thinkin' you so bad jes cuz you was in SOLDIER." He lunged at Cloud, but Biggs, surprisingly quick for his size, stepped between them, trying to hold Barret back. Barret, in his rage, shoved Biggs aside, sending him sprawling against the wall. He stood there, seething, his gun-arm trembling.

Cloud remained impassive. "............"

"Yeah, you're strong," Barret conceded, his voice tight with resentment. "Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are. But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now! Don't get no ideas 'bout hangin' on to Shinra."

"Stayin' with Shinra?" Cloud’s voice was dangerously soft. "You asked me a question and I answered it... that's all." He turned to leave. "I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money."

"Shucks!! ............money..." Barret muttered, deflation seeping into his anger.

Marlene, who had been watching with wide eyes, piped up, "Papa, you're so great!"

Tifa, who had descended the elevator shaft during the confrontation, rushed to Cloud's side as he started to leave. "Wait, Cloud!"

Barret’s anger flared anew. "Tifa! Let him go! Looks like he still misses the Shinra!"

Cloud whirled around, his Mako-infused eyes blazing. "Shut up! I don't care about either Shinra or SOLDIER! But don't get me wrong! I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!" The words were a raw outburst, a glimpse of the frustration simmering beneath his cool exterior.

Tifa placed a calming hand on his arm. "Straighten things up with everyone for me."

Cloud took a deep breath, the anger receding as quickly as it had come. He looked at Wedge, who was watching him with a mixture of fear and curiosity. "Cloud... You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me. Cloud... You just want friends. Isn't that right?"

Cloud considered Wedge’s hopeful expression. "Blow off," he said, but the usual bite was missing from his voice.

Wedge smiled sadly. "Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me. If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me."

Cloud merely nodded and ascended the elevator, leaving the tense atmosphere of the hideout behind.

# Chapter 3: A Promise Forged in Starlight

Cloud found Tifa waiting for him in the empty bar, the faint scent of the flower she’d placed in a vase mingling with the lingering smell of stale beer and old regrets. The usual boisterous energy of 7th Heaven was absent, replaced by a heavy silence that seemed to amplify the unspoken tension between them.

"Listen, Cloud," Tifa began, her voice earnest. "I'm asking you. Please join us."

Cloud shook his head, the movement barely perceptible. "Sorry Tifa..."

"The Planet is dying," she pressed, her eyes pleading. "Slowly but surely it's dying. Someone has to do something."

"So let Barret and his buddies do something about it," Cloud retorted, his voice flat. "It's got nothin' to do with me."

Tifa's expression hardened. "So! You're really leaving!? You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend!?"

The accusation stung. "What......? How can you say that!"

A shadow of pain crossed Tifa's face. "......You forgot the promise, too."

"Promise?" Cloud frowned. The word stirred something vague within him, a distant echo he couldn't quite grasp.

"So you DID forget," Tifa said, her voice laced with disappointment. "Remember...... Cloud. It was seven years ago..."

The world around him seemed to shimmer, the familiar confines of 7th Heaven dissolving into a memory, sharp and clear. The scent of pine and damp earth filled his nostrils, the cool night air raising goosebumps on his skin. He was younger, a boy on the cusp of manhood, standing beside the old water tower in Nibelheim, their hometown. The sky above was a vast, inky canvas, splattered with a million glittering stars.

"Look, the well," Tifa's voice, younger, yet achingly familiar, whispered beside him. "Do you remember?"

"Yeah... back then," Cloud heard his younger self reply. "I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold."

A younger Tifa, her eyes bright with unshed tears and youthful dreams, materialized before him. "Sorry I'm late," she said, her breath misting in the chill air. "You said you wanted to talk to me about something?"

Young Cloud, brimming with a nervous energy that his older self rarely displayed, climbed onto the edge of the well. "Come this spring... I'm leaving this town for Midgar."

"All boys are leaving our town," Tifa replied, a hint of sadness in her voice.

"But I'm different from all of them," young Cloud declared, his voice full of youthful bravado. "I'm not just going to find a job. I want to join SOLDIER. I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth!"

"Sephiroth..." Tifa breathed, awe in her voice. "The Great Sephiroth."

"Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?" she asked, her gaze fixed on him.

Young Cloud nodded, a flicker of uncertainty in his eyes. "...I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while."

Tifa made a small, choked sound, her hands flying to her face. "Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?"

"I'll try," he promised.

"Hey, why don't we make a promise?" Tifa suggested, her eyes sparkling with a sudden idea. "Umm, if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind...... You come save me, all right?"

"What?" young Cloud asked, taken aback.

"Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me," Tifa elaborated, her voice full of romantic notions. "I want to at least experience that once."

"What?"

"Come on--! Promise me----!" she insisted, her gaze unwavering.

Young Cloud hesitated for a moment, then a slow smile spread across his face. "All right...... I promise."

As if to seal their vow, a shooting star blazed across the Nibelheim sky, a fleeting streak of silver against the darkness.

The memory faded, the scent of pine and starlight replaced by the stale air of 7th Heaven. Tifa was watching him, her eyes searching his.

"You remember now, don't you... our promise?"

Cloud looked away, a familiar ache tightening his chest. "I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. I can't keep...... the promise."

"But you got your childhood dream, didn't you?" Tifa countered, her voice gentle but firm. "You joined SOLDIER. So come on! You've got to keep your promise......"

The whir of the elevator interrupted them. Barret emerged, his face set in a grim expression. "Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER! A promise is a promise! Here!!" He thrust a small pouch into Cloud’s hand. It clinked softly. Cloud received 1500 gil.

"This is my pay?" Cloud scoffed, the amount a paltry sum for the risks he’d taken. "Don't make me laugh."

Tifa’s eyes lit up. "What? Then you'll...!!"

Cloud met Barret’s gaze. "You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000."

Barret sputtered, "What......!?"

Tifa quickly stepped in, placing a hand on Barret’s arm. "It's ok, it's ok." She leaned in, whispering urgently, "Psst, psst...... (We're really hurting for help, right?)"

Barret grumbled, his gaze shifting from Cloud to Tifa and back again. "Uh...... ugh...... (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'......)" He sighed, a sound like a deflating bellows. "2000!"

Tifa beamed. "Thanks, Cloud."

Cloud merely nodded, the weight of the past, and the unexpected resurfacing of a forgotten promise, settling heavily upon him. He still didn't care about their cause, or the Planet. But Tifa... Tifa was different. He had made a promise. And for reasons he couldn't quite articulate, that promise, and the earnest plea in her eyes, was enough to make him stay. For now.

---

The night passed fitfully. Cloud, accustomed to rougher accommodations, found the cot in the AVALANCHE hideout surprisingly uncomfortable. Or perhaps it was the lingering echoes of the Nibelheim memory, the weight of Tifa's rediscovered promise, that kept him restless. He rose before dawn, the grey light of Midgar’s perpetual twilight filtering through the grimy windows of 7th Heaven.

Tifa was already awake, wiping down the bar, the single yellow flower a small beacon of color in the dim light. "Good Morning! Cloud!" she greeted him, her smile a little too bright. "Did you sleep well?"

Cloud grunted. "Barret's snoring kept me up......"

Tifa chuckled, her voice low. "Psstpsst... (keep it down, they'll hear you. Barret's always edgy before an operation.)" She paused, her gaze searching his. "I'm going this time."

Before Cloud could respond, Barret emerged from the basement, his usual boisterous energy somewhat subdued. "Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first. I'll fill you in on the train." He stopped, his expression uncharacteristically hesitant. "Yo! Cloud! Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you! I, uh,...... I don't really know how to use Materia! I'll give you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it!"

Cloud sighed. This was not how he'd envisioned his morning. "Ok, I'll explain it." He patiently walked Barret through the basics of equipping and using Materia, the crystallized Mako energy that granted its wielder access to the Planet's powers – what many called magic. Shinra had mastered its exploitation, turning it into a commodity, but its true nature, its connection to the Lifestream and the Ancients, was a concept that still eluded most. Barret, for all his bluster about saving the Planet, seemed to grasp little of its intricacies.

"Shi......! What's this 'It wasn't that tough!' crap!" Barret exclaimed when Cloud finished. "I'm clueless...... Well, you handle the Materia then!"

Tifa, who had been listening with a quiet smile, chimed in. "Cloud! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs. He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!" She turned to Marlene, who had just emerged from the back room, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!"

"All right!! Good Luck. Take care!" Marlene chirped, her earlier shyness forgotten.

Cloud, Tifa, and Barret left 7th Heaven, the weight of their upcoming mission settling upon them. The Sector 7 slums were already stirring, the sounds of a city struggling to life echoing through the narrow, refuse-strewn streets. Cloud made a quick detour to the Weapons Shop, where the grizzled proprietor, after a bit of prodding, reluctantly handed over a small, unassuming sphere of Materia. "It's an 'All' Materia," he grunted. "Might come in handy."

Cloud then ascended to the "Beginner's Hall" above the shop, a makeshift training area where a motley collection of slum dwellers were attempting to hone their combat skills. He found himself, much to his surprise, dispensing advice on everything from saving game data – a concept utterly alien in this world of harsh realities – to the finer points of Materia combination. The irony was not lost on him. He, who cared so little for their cause, was now their impromptu instructor.

As he explained the intricacies of linking Materia, of elemental strengths and weaknesses, he saw a flicker of understanding in their eyes, a dawning of hope. Perhaps, he mused, there was more to this than just gil. Perhaps, in some small way, he was making a difference. It was a fleeting thought, quickly suppressed. He was a mercenary. This was just another job.

Outside, a small crowd had gathered. Johnny, a local youth with more bravado than brains, was making a dramatic departure. "I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better man! This is goodbye! Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of Tifa!" He ran off, leaving a trail of bewildered onlookers in his wake.

Cloud rejoined Tifa and Barret, the cryptic comments and strange encounters of the morning fading into the background as they approached the Sector 7 train station. The mission awaited. The No. 5 Reactor. Another node in Shinra’s vast network, another artery draining the lifeblood of the Planet. And Cloud, the ex-SOLDIER, the reluctant mercenary, was once again at the heart of it.

<div id="chapter-4"></div>

# Chapter 4: Whispers of Discontent

The train to Sector 4 was, as usual, a microcosm of Midgar's stratified society. Shinra employees in crisp uniforms occupied the cleaner, more comfortable cars, while the slum dwellers and AVALANCHE members were relegated to the grittier, less maintained sections. As Cloud, Tifa, and Barret boarded, a familiar tension filled the air.

"YO! Looks like this ain't no private car!! So split up!!" Barret bellowed, ever mindful of maintaining a low profile, though his booming voice and conspicuous gun-arm rather defeated the purpose.

Tifa nodded, her expression serious. "Right. We can't afford to draw attention."

Cloud, however, found his attention drawn to a Shinra manager who was muttering under his breath, "…hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck…"

Barret, his hearing surprisingly acute, whirled around. "You say sumthin'?" he growled, his voice a low threat. The manager jumped, his face paling. "I said, 'you say sumthin'!?' Yo, look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden. What's goin' on?"

The manager, clearly terrified, stammered, "DAMN!! I... it's empty because of... g, guys like you..."

Barret slammed his fist against the wall above the manager's head, making him yelp. "Y, Y, YIPES!! You... you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings. Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today."

Barret leaned in, his gun-arm glinting ominously. "You workin' for Shinra?"

The manager, summoning a surprising amount of courage, or perhaps just sheer terror-induced defiance, declared, "I won't give in to violence... and I'm not giving up my seat either!"

"Barret!!" Tifa's sharp voice cut through the tension.

"&$\#%\!\! You lucky ^$\#^$.!" Barret snarled, reluctantly backing down. Tifa rushed over to the trembling manager, offering a quick, apologetic bow before rejoining Cloud and Barret.

"So, what are we gonna do now?" Cloud asked, his voice carefully neutral.

Barret scowled. "Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm..." The train lurched into motion, the rhythmic clatter of the wheels a familiar backdrop to their clandestine operations.

Tifa glanced at the railway map monitor on the wall. "Seems like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving."

"So what's our next target?" Cloud pressed.

"Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!" Barret mocked, though there was a grudging respect in his tone. "Awright... I'll tell ya! Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate. It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains."

"Which Shinra is very proud of," Tifa added dryly.

"We can't use our fake ID's anymore..." Barret admitted, a note of frustration in his voice. The intercom crackled: _Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines. Arrival time at Sector 4 Station will 11:45._

Tifa’s eyes widened. "That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point."

Barret nodded grimly. "Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train. Got it!?" He sat down, his massive frame radiating a coiled energy.

Tifa beckoned Cloud to the map monitor. "Cloud, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor." As Cloud approached, a red light suddenly began to flash, bathing the car in an urgent, pulsing glow. "That's odd," Tifa murmured, her brow furrowed. "The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down."

The intercom crackled again, this time with a far more ominous message: _Type A Security Alert!! Unidentified passengers confirmed... A search of all cars will be conducted! Repeat!! Type A Security Alert!!_

"What's happening?" Tifa exclaimed, her voice tight with alarm.

"What's goin' on!!" Barret roared, leaping to his feet.

Jessie burst into the car from the adjoining one, her face pale. "We're in trouble. I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!"

"^%\#@%\! Someone blew it..." Barret cursed, already moving. _Unidentified passengers located in Car #1. Preparing for Lock Down,_ the intercom announced, a chilling finality in its synthesized voice. "Let's go! Keep it up!"

They scrambled into the next car, the sound of the first car's doors locking echoing behind them. _Car #1: Locked Down. Upgrading to Level 2 Warning._ Biggs and Wedge were already there, their faces grim. "Hurry!" Biggs urged. "They're gonna lock the door, sir!" Wedge added, his voice trembling.

_Unidentified passengers located in Car #2. Preparing for Lock Down._ "Just run!" Jessie yelled, shoving past a bewildered passenger. "Changing to Plan 2!"

They continued their desperate flight through the train, each locked door a stark reminder of their dwindling options. _Car #2: Locked down. Upgrading to Warning Level 3._ In the third car, they encountered a pickpocket attempting to relieve an unconscious passenger of his valuables, and Johnny, the youth from Sector 7, sobbing in a corner, his dreams of adventure clearly not living up to reality.

_Car #3: Locked Down. Upgrading to Warning Level 4._ The fourth car was a bizarre scene of chaos – three men stripped to their underwear, victims of "underwear bandits," one of them clutching a bomb that Jessie had apparently forced him to take.

_Car #4: Locked Down. Upgrading to maximum security alert!!_ Finally, they reached the fifth car, where Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie, now in hastily donned disguises, awaited them.

"All right!! We made it!" Barret panted, relief evident in his voice. "Yo!! This way!! Let's go!! We're gonna dive outta here!!"

Wedge, dressed in overalls that made him look even younger than he was, managed a weak smile. "Guess who? It's me, Wedge! Looks like things were a success. I look just like my little brother in these clothes... I wonder how everyone's doin' now...?"

Jessie, surprisingly fetching in a red Shinra uniform, preened. "It's me, Jessie. How do I look, Cloud? Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?"

Cloud, despite the urgency of the situation, found himself offering a grudging, "Yeah... you look great, just like a man."

Jessie’s face fell for a moment, then she brightened. "Yay!! I'm so happy ...I think?"

Tifa, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and adrenaline, murmured, "...Scary... huh."

"Too late to be saying that now," Cloud retorted. "Why'd you come along anyway?"

"Because..." Tifa began, but Barret cut her off.

"Hey you two! There ain't no time for that! Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!! ...do something!"

Tifa took a deep breath, her resolve hardening. "Yeah!! I've made up my mind! Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!" With a determined cry, she leaped from the speeding train, disappearing into the darkness below.

Cloud turned to Barret. "You don't care if I go first?"

Barret grinned, a fierce, almost joyful light in his eyes. "A leader always stays till the end. Don't worry 'bout me, just go! Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt! It's only the beginnin' of the mission!"

Cloud shrugged, a familiar gesture of detached acceptance, and then, with a powerful thrust of his legs, he too launched himself into the abyss, the wind roaring in his ears as he plummeted towards the unseen ground. The mission to destroy the Sector 5 Reactor had begun, and already, it was steeped in chaos and uncertainty.

---

They landed, hard, in the grimy, labyrinthine tunnels beneath the Sector 4 plate. The air was thick with the stench of Mako and decay, the only light emanating from the sickly green glow of exposed Mako pipes.

"Good, so far everything's going as planned," Barret grunted, though his dishevelled appearance suggested otherwise. "Better not let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor. Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it. Well, the reactor's just down this tunnel!"

At the end of the tunnel, their path was blocked by a crisscrossing network of light beams. "Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors," Cloud observed, his SOLDIER training kicking in. "We can't go any further. After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by the security sensor." He spotted a small airduct nearby. "That's one damn tiny hole," Barret complained. "You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!"

Cloud peered into the duct. "Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back up here."

"Don't be wastin' time," Barret urged. "Never know when the Shinra'll find us. Cloud you jes' gotta go."

With a shared nod, they squeezed into the narrow duct, emerging onto a series of precarious maintenance walkways high above the Sector 5 slums. Wedge was waiting for them. "Cloud, this way. The reactor's up this ladder."

As they ascended, they encountered Jessie, her face smudged with grease, a look of contrition in her eyes. "I'm sorry. The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault. I made your ID card special...... So that's why it happened... I put my heart into making it. But I failed. Next time, I'll give you something more decent. I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it."

Further on, Biggs gave them a weary salute. "We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout. Cloud, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!"

They pressed on, the reactor looming larger with each step. As they neared its core, Cloud stumbled, his vision blurring. The familiar crimson haze washed over him, the disorienting hum filling his ears. An image flashed before his eyes – Tifa, years younger, kneeling beside a fallen figure in the Nibelheim reactor, her face contorted with grief and rage. _Papa... Sephiroth!? Sephiroth did this to you, didn't he!? Sephiroth... SOLDIER... Mako Reactors... Shinra... Everything! I hate them all!_ The image of her, wild-eyed, brandishing Sephiroth’s massive Masamune blade, seared itself into his mind.

"Damn man, get a hold of yourself!" Barret’s voice, rough and concerned, pulled him back to the present.

Tifa was beside him, her hand on his arm. "You all right?"

Cloud shook his head, trying to clear the disturbing vision. "......Tifa."

"Mmm?"

"No... forget...... Come on, let's hurry!" He pushed himself to his feet, turning to Barret. "I know. You're my watch, right?"

Barret grunted. "Damn straight. Tifa's old friend... That ain't good enough."

Cloud set the bomb, the metallic click echoing in the oppressive silence of the reactor core. They rushed back towards the elevator, their escape route now a race against time. Reaching a closed door, Tifa pointed to a side room with three large buttons. "Jessie said we all have to push the buttons at once."

After a few fumbled attempts, they managed to synchronize their timing, the door hissing open. They ran out onto the bridge connecting the reactor to the exit, but their path was blocked by a squad of Shinra soldiers.

"Shinra soldiers!?" Barret exclaimed. "SHIT! What the hell's goin' on?"

Cloud’s eyes narrowed. "...a trap..."

The distinct sound of footsteps echoed from behind them. They whirled around to see President Shinra himself emerge from the reactor, his face a mask of cold amusement.

"Presi... President Shinra?" Barret stammered, momentarily stunned.

Tifa’s voice was a shocked whisper. "Why is the President here?"

"Hmm... So you all must be that... ...what was it?" the President mused, his tone dismissive.

Barret’s shock quickly turned to rage. "AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! And you're President Shinra, huh?"

Cloud stepped forward, his voice low and steady. "Long time no see, President."

The President’s gaze flickered over Cloud, a hint of recognition in his cold eyes. "...Long time no see? Oh... you. You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes... Tell me, traitor... what was your name?"

"Cloud."

"Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember each person's name. Unless you become another Sephiroth. Yes, Sephiroth... He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant..."

The name, Sephiroth, sent a jolt through Cloud. He took an involuntary step back. "Sephiroth......?"

Barret, recovering his composure, shoved Cloud aside. "Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!"

The President chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. "And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you..."

"VERMIN!?" Barret roared. "That's all you can say... VERMIN! Y'all Shinra're the VERMIN, killing the planet! And that makes you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!"

"You are beginning to bore me," the President stated, his voice laced with aristocratic disdain. "I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me... I have a dinner I must attend."

"Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!"

"But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all." He snapped his fingers. A whirring sound, growing louder, emanated from the reactor.

"!? What's that noise?" Tifa cried, her eyes darting nervously.

"The hell is this!?" Barret demanded.

A sleek, heavily armed robot, the Airbuster, zoomed into view, its targeting lasers already fixed on them. "Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier," the President announced, a cruel smile playing on his lips. "Our Weapon Development Department created him. I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments."

"...Techno-soldier?" Cloud muttered, his hand already reaching for the Buster Sword.

A helicopter descended, hovering near the President. "Now then, if you'll excuse me."

"Wait, President!" Cloud shouted, but it was too late. Shinra climbed aboard, and the helicopter ascended, leaving them to face the mechanical monstrosity.

The Airbuster lunged, its metallic claws tearing at the gantry. "Help, Cloud!" Tifa screamed. "THIS is from SOLDIER?"

"No way!" Cloud yelled back, parrying a blow from the robot. "It's just a machine."

"I don't care what it is!!" Barret roared, his gun-arm blazing. "I'm gonna bust him up!!"

The battle was brutal. The Airbuster was fast and powerful, its arsenal of weapons seemingly endless. But Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fought with a desperate courage, their attacks slowly chipping away at the robot's defenses. Finally, with a deafening explosion, the Airbuster went down, its metallic frame collapsing in a shower of sparks and twisted metal.

The force of the explosion ripped through the bridge, sending Cloud tumbling towards the chasm below. He managed to grab the edge of the fractured gantry, his fingers scrabbling for purchase, the Mako-infused depths of the reactor yawning beneath him.

"It's gonna blow! Let's go, Tifa!" Barret yelled, pulling her away from the precipice.

"Barret! Can't you do something?" Tifa cried, her eyes fixed on Cloud.

"Not a damn thing."

"Cloud! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!"

Cloud gritted his teeth, his grip slipping. "I know, Tifa......"

Barret’s voice, rough with a reluctant concern, reached him. "Hey, you gonna be awright?"

Cloud mustered a grim smile. "Be strong. You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of Tifa!"

"Alright. Sorry 'bout all this," Barret conceded.

"Stop talkin' like this is the end!" Cloud yelled, but his fingers were losing their hold.

The reactor detonated, a cataclysmic explosion that tore the very air apart. The shockwave slammed into Cloud, ripping him from his precarious hold. He plummeted into the darkness, the last thing he saw Tifa's outstretched hand, her cry lost in the roar of the explosion. Then, only blackness, and the chilling, endless fall.

# Chapter 5: The Flower Girl of Sector 5

_…You all right?_

A gentle voice, a woman’s, filtered through the haze of unconsciousness.

_…Can you hear me?_

Cloud groaned, a dull ache throbbing through his body. “…Yeah…”

_Back then… You could get by with just skinned knees…_

He struggled to open his eyes, the world a confusing blur. “…What do you mean by ‘back then’?”

_What about now? Can you get up?_

He tried to push himself up, but his limbs felt heavy, unresponsive. “…What do you mean by ‘that time’? …What about now?”

_…Don’t worry about me. You just worry about yourself now._

With a monumental effort, he managed to sit up, the world slowly resolving into focus. He was in a flower bed, the vibrant colors a stark contrast to the grimy, dilapidated interior of an old church. Soft light filtered through holes in the crumbling roof, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air.

And then he saw her. The flower girl from Sector 8. Aeris. She was kneeling beside him, her expression a mixture of concern and relief.

"Oh! It moved!" she exclaimed, a genuine warmth in her voice. "Whew... Am I glad." She tilted her head. "Hello, hello?"

Cloud blinked, trying to clear the fog from his mind. “…I know. Hey… who are you?” He recognized her, but the fall had muddled his thoughts.

Aeris smiled. "You okay? This is a church in the Sector 5 slums. It suddenly fell on top of me. It really gave me a scare."

Cloud looked up at the gaping hole in the roof, then back at the surprisingly intact flower bed. "...I came crashing down?"

"The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky."

"Flower bed...... is this yours?" He scrambled to his feet, a pang of guilt hitting him. "Sorry about that."

Aeris’s smile didn’t falter. "That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place. They say you can't grow grass and flowers in Midgar. But for some reason, the flowers have no trouble blooming here. I love it here."

A faint noise from behind the main doors of the church made Cloud tense. A gruff male voice, muffled but discernible, muttered, "I'll give you a little more time."

Aeris’s eyes darted towards the sound, then back to Cloud. "......So, we meet again." A playful lilt entered her voice. "......Don't you remember me?"

Cloud’s memory, still hazy from the fall, struggled to place her. "Yeah, I remember you...... You were selling flowers."

Aeris beamed. "Oh! I'm so happy! Thanks for buying my flowers." Her gaze was direct, her Mako-green eyes surprisingly perceptive. "Say, do you have any materia?"

"Yes, some," Cloud admitted. "Nowadays you can find materia anywhere."

"But mine is special," Aeris said, a hint of mystery in her voice. "It's good for absolutely nothing."

Cloud frowned. "...good for nothing? You probably just don't know how to use it."

"No, I do...... it just doesn't do anything." She touched a small, milky-white orb nestled in her hair. "I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's...... Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it? After all, here we are meeting again, right?"

Before Cloud could answer, the main doors of the church creaked open, and a figure in a sharp blue suit stepped inside. He was tall and lean, with fiery red hair tied back in a neat ponytail. His eyes, cold and calculating, swept the room, lingering for a moment on Aeris before settling on Cloud. Reno, of the Turks. Cloud recognized the uniform, the arrogant set of his jaw. Shinra’s hounds.

"The name's Cloud," he said, his voice low and steady, addressing Aeris but acutely aware of the newcomer. "Me......? I do a little bit of everything."

Aeris giggled. "Oh...... a jack of all trades."

"Yeah, I do whatever's needed." Cloud’s gaze flickered towards Reno. "What's so funny? What are you laughing at?"

Aeris’s laughter died as she too noticed Reno. "Sorry...... bad timing on my part." She shot Cloud a reassuring glance. "Cloud! Don't let it get to you!"

Reno sauntered further into the church, his footsteps echoing on the stone floor. "Don't worry about me," he said, his voice smooth and dangerous.

Aeris turned back to Cloud, her eyes sparkling with a sudden idea. "Say, Cloud. Have you ever been a bodyguard? You DO do everything, right?"

Cloud’tensed. He knew where this was going. "...Yeah, that's right."

"Then, get me out of here. Take me home."

He hesitated for a fraction of a second. This wasn't his fight. But looking at Aeris, at the quiet determination in her eyes, at the way Reno was watching them, like a predator sizing up its prey... "OK, I'll do it... but it'll cost you."

Aeris’s smile was dazzling. "Well then, let's see...... How about if I go out with you once?"

Cloud stepped back, shaking his finger at her in mock admonishment, then turned to face Reno. "I don't know who you are, but......"

Reno’s lips curved into a smirk. "You don't know me......? ......I know you."

A flash of white, a searing pain behind Cloud’s eyes. He stumbled, clutching his head. _Mako eyes..._ The words echoed in his mind, a disembodied whisper.

"Oh yeah...... I know you," Cloud managed, his voice strained. "That uniform......"

Three Shinra soldiers, their faces grim, entered the church, flanking Reno. "......Hey sis, this one's a little weird," one of them commented, his gaze fixed on Aeris.

Cloud straightened, his hand instinctively going to the hilt of the Buster Sword. "Shut up! You Shinra spy!"

"Reno! Want him taken out?" another soldier asked, his hand reaching for his weapon.

Reno’s smirk widened. "I haven't decided yet."

"Don't fight here!" Aeris cried, her voice sharp with alarm. "You'll ruin the flowers!" She darted towards a door to the left of the altar. "The exit is back there."

Cloud didn't need telling twice. He followed Aeris, the two of them disappearing into the back room just as Reno and his men began to advance. Reno paused, his gaze sweeping over the flower bed, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. "They were...... Mako eyes. Yeah, all right. Back to work, back to work." He started towards the exit, then stopped, looking back at the flowers. "Oh! And don't step on the flowers......"

"Hey Reno, you just stepped on them!" one of the soldiers pointed out. "They're all ruined! You're gonna catch holy hell!"

In the back room, Cloud and Aeris scrambled up a rickety set of stairs leading to the church rafters. A wide gap in the decaying floorboards blocked their path. Reno and his men burst into the room below.

"There they are, over there!" Reno yelled.

Aeris pointed towards the gap. "Cloud... that one!"

"I know," Cloud replied, his eyes narrowed in concentration. "Looks like they aren't going to let us go."

"What should we do?"

"Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left." With a powerful leap, Cloud cleared the gap, landing lightly on the other side. "Aeris! This way!"

Aeris approached the edge, her eyes wide with apprehension. She shook her head. Cloud nodded, understanding. "All right. I'll hold them off."

"Right. Make sure they don't get through!"

"The Ancient is getting away!" Reno shouted. "Attack! Attack! Attack!"

A hail of gunfire erupted from below. Aeris cried out, tumbling from the rafters to the floor below. "Eaygh!!"

"Aeris!" Cloud yelled, his heart lurching. He spotted a stack of barrels precariously balanced on a nearby rafter. An idea sparked. "Aeris! Hold on a minute!" He shoved at the nearest barrel. It teetered, then fell, crashing down onto one of the soldiers below, sending him sprawling. He quickly pushed two more, scattering the remaining soldiers.

"Thanks, Cloud," Aeris called up, scrambling to her feet. She darted up the stairs, rejoining him in the rafters.

"Aeris, this way," Cloud urged, leading her through a hole in the roof and out onto the crumbling shingles.

They paused for a moment, catching their breath, the sounds of pursuit echoing from below. "Ha, ha...... They're looking for me again," Aeris said, a wry smile on her lips.

"You mean it's not the first time they've been after you?"

"...no."

"They're the Turks," Cloud stated. "The Turks are an organization in Shinra. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER."

"This violently?" Aeris asked, her eyes wide. "I thought they were kidnapping someone."

"They're also involved in a lot of dirty stuff on the side. Spying, murder... you know."

"They look like it." Aeris’s gaze met his, a question in her eyes. "But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?"

Aeris laughed, a light, musical sound. "No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER!"

Cloud considered her. "Maybe you do. You want to join?"

"I don't know... But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!"

"Then, let's go!" He started off across the rooftops, his movements sure and swift. Aeris struggled to keep up.

"Wait... Wait, I said!" she panted, finally catching up to him. "Puff... wheeze... Slow...... down... Don't leave me......"

Cloud smirked. "Funny... I thought you were cut out to be in SOLDIER?"

"Oh! You're terrible!" Aeris retorted, but there was no real anger in her voice. They both laughed, a shared moment of levity in the midst of danger. "Hey...... Cloud," Aeris began, her tone suddenly serious. "Were you... ever in SOLDIER?"

Cloud hesitated. "...I used to be. How did you guess?"

"Your eyes. They have a strange glow..."

"That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako... A mark of SOLDIER. But, how did you know about that?"

Aeris looked away, a shadow crossing her features. "......Oh, nothing."

"Nothing...?"

"Right, nothing!" she insisted, her playful demeanor returning. "Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!"

They continued their precarious journey across the rooftops, finally leaping down into a narrow alleyway. "Whew! Finally made it off!" Aeris exclaimed, brushing dust from her dress. "Now what..." She looked around, orienting herself. "My house is over here. Hurry before he comes."

She led him through the winding streets of Sector 5, a place as impoverished and polluted as Sector 7, yet somehow imbued with a quiet resilience, perhaps a reflection of Aeris herself. They passed a man in a straw hat muttering about Wall Market in Sector 6, a woman diligently searching the ground for dropped valuables, and a person living in a converted segment of pipe, muttering incoherently, a tattoo of the number ‘2’ visible on his arm – another disturbing echo of the Sephiroth clones Cloud had encountered in Nibelheim.

Finally, they reached Aeris’s house, a small, surprisingly well-kept cottage surrounded by a riot of colorful flowers, a vibrant oasis in the midst of the slum’s decay. An older woman, her face etched with worry lines but her eyes kind, greeted them at the door.

"I'm home, mom," Aeris announced, a cheerful lilt in her voice. "This is Cloud. My bodyguard."

The woman – Elmyra, Aeris’s adoptive mother – rushed forward, her gaze anxious. "Bodyguard......? You mean you were followed again!? Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?"

"I'm all right," Aeris reassured her. "I had Cloud with me."

Elmyra turned to Cloud, her expression softening. "Thank you, Cloud." She then bustled upstairs, leaving Cloud and Aeris alone in the cozy living room.

"So what are you going to do now?" Aeris asked, her gaze curious.

Cloud hesitated. "...Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to Tifa's bar."

Aeris’s eyes sparkled with a mischievous light. "Is Tifa...... a girl?"

"Yeah."

"A girl...friend?"

Cloud scowled. "No way!"

Aeris giggled. "Hee hee hee...... You don't have to get THAT upset..." She paused, then continued, "Well, that's... nice. Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way."

"You gotta be kidding," Cloud protested. "Why do you want to put yourself in danger again?"

"I'm used to it," Aeris replied, her tone surprisingly nonchalant.

"Used to it!? ......Well, don't know... getting help from a girl..."

Aeris’s eyes flashed. "A girl!! What do you mean by that!? You expect me to just sit by and listen, after hearing you say something like that!?" She turned towards the stairs. "Mom! I'm taking Cloud to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while."

Elmyra reappeared, a resigned sigh escaping her lips. "But dear... I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind. But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now."

Aeris considered this. "Yeah, you're right, mom."

"Aeris, please go and make the bed," Elmyra instructed. Aeris nodded and disappeared upstairs. Elmyra turned to Cloud, her gaze searching. "That glow in your eyes... you're from SOLDIER, right?"

"Yeah. Rather I used to be..."

Elmyra’s expression grew somber. "......I don't know how to say this, but... Would you please leave here, tonight? Without telling Aeris. SOLDIER... the last thing Aeris needs is to get her feelings hurt again..."

Cloud ascended the stairs, his mind a whirl of conflicting emotions. Aeris was waiting for him in a small guest room. "You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a little dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight." She smiled, a genuine, heartfelt expression. "Cloud... Good night." She turned and went downstairs, leaving Cloud alone with his thoughts.

_Oh, man..._ He sank onto the bed, the events of the past few days catching up with him. The bombing mission, the fall, the encounter with the Turks, Aeris’s strange connection to SOLDIER… and Elmyra’s cryptic warning. He felt a familiar weariness settle over him, a bone-deep exhaustion that had nothing to do with physical exertion. He closed his eyes, images of his past, of Nibelheim, of his mother, flickering behind his eyelids.

_My, how you've grown,_ his mother’s voice echoed in his mind. _I'll bet the girls never leave you alone._

_...Not really._

_...I'm worried about you. There are a lot of temptations in the city... I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down and had a nice girlfriend._

_...I'm all right._

_You should have... an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you. I think that would be the perfect type for you._

_......I'm not interested._

He drifted into an uneasy sleep, the memories of his mother mingling with the unsettling premonition that Aeris, the enigmatic flower girl, was somehow inextricably linked to his own shrouded past, and the even more dangerous future that lay ahead.

<div id="chapter-6"></div>

# Chapter 6: The Labyrinth of Wall Market

Cloud woke with a start, the lingering echoes of his mother's voice fading into the pre-dawn gloom. He had to leave, before Aeris woke, before Elmyra’s words and his own unsettling premonitions could take root. _Sector 7's past Sector 6... I should be all right by myself..._

He crept out of the room, his movements silent, honed by years of SOLDIER training. As he passed Aeris's room, a floorboard creaked beneath his weight. He froze, his heart pounding, but there was no sound from within. With a sigh of relief, he continued downstairs and slipped out of the house, the scent of flowers a poignant farewell.

The Sector 5 slums were still shrouded in darkness, the only light emanating from the flickering Mako lamps and the distant, oppressive glow of the upper plate. He navigated the labyrinthine streets with a practiced ease, his mind already focused on reaching Tifa’s bar. But as he neared the exit to Sector 6, a familiar figure stepped out of the shadows.

Aeris.

"You're up bright and early," she said, her voice devoid of surprise, her Mako-green eyes sparkling with an infuriating amusement.

Cloud sighed, a mixture of annoyance and reluctant admiration warring within him. "How could I ask you to go along when I knew it would be dangerous?"

Aeris tilted her head, a playful smile dancing on her lips. "Are you done?"

Cloud scratched his head, a sheepish grin tugging at the corner of his mouth. He should have known she wouldn't be so easily deterred.

"You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to Tifa's 7th Heaven," Aeris stated, her tone practical. "I'll take you there. Come on!" She turned and darted off, her laughter echoing in the narrow alleyway. Cloud, with a sigh that was more resigned than exasperated, followed.

Sector 6 was a chaotic, sprawling marketplace, a testament to the resilience and resourcefulness of the slum dwellers. makeshift stalls hawked everything from salvaged tech to questionable foodstuffs, the air thick with the smell of grilling meat, cheap perfume, and desperation. As they neared a children's playground, a strangely incongruous splash of color in the midst of the urban decay, Aeris pointed towards a heavily guarded gate.

"The gate to Sector 7's in there."

Cloud nodded. "Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?"

Aeris feigned a damsel-in-distress swoon. "Oh no! 'What ever will I do!?' ...isn't that what you want me to say?" Cloud considered taking her home, but knew it was out of the way. "Take her to Sector 7," he decided internally, "I could do that. But won't I be in your way?" she asked, innocence in her eyes. Cloud just grunted. "Nothing!" Aeris chirped. "Can we take a break?"

Before Cloud could reply, she darted into the playground, her gaze fixed on a brightly painted slide shaped like a cat's face. "I can't believe it's still here," she murmured, a wistful expression on her face. She scrambled up the slide, perching on top like a mischievous pixie. "Cloud, over here!"

With a shrug, Cloud joined her, the incongruity of the situation – an ex-SOLDIER and an enigmatic flower girl perched on a children's slide in the heart of the slums – not lost on him.

"What rank were you?" Aeris asked, her voice suddenly serious.

"Rank?"

"You know, in SOLDIER."

Cloud hesitated, a familiar flicker of unease stirring within him. "Oh, I was..." A brief, sharp flash of an image he couldn't quite grasp. "First Class."

Aeris’s eyes widened. "Just the same as him."

"The same as who?"

"My first boyfriend."

Cloud felt an unexpected pang of... something. Jealousy? Curiosity? "You were... serious?"

Aeris shook her head, a faint smile playing on her lips. "No. But I liked him for a while."

"I probably knew him," Cloud said, the words tasting like ash in his mouth. "What was his name?"

"It doesn't really matter," Aeris replied, her gaze distant.

Suddenly, the gate to Sector 7 creaked open, and a chocobo-drawn carriage emerged, its gaudy trappings a stark contrast to the surrounding squalor. And in the back, her expression a mixture of apprehension and forced gaiety, sat Tifa, dressed in an elaborate, unfamiliar blue gown.

Cloud leaped to his feet, his heart pounding. "Huh? Hey, back there...... Tifa!?"

The carriage clattered past them, disappearing into the labyrinthine streets of Wall Market, Sector 6's notorious entertainment district.

Aeris jumped off the slide, her earlier playfulness replaced by a concerned frown. "That girl in the cart was Tifa? Where was she going? She looked kind of odd..." She started after the carriage, her voice urgent.

Cloud hesitated for a moment, then sighed. "Wait! I'll go on alone! You go on home!" But even as he spoke, he knew it was a futile gesture. Aeris was already disappearing into the throng, her determination a palpable force. With a muttered curse, Cloud followed, plunging into the chaotic, dangerous heart of Wall Market.

The air in Wall Market was thick with the scent of cheap perfume, stale booze, and desperation. Gaudy neon signs flickered, casting an unholy glow on the throngs of people milling about – slum dwellers seeking a momentary escape, Shinra off-duty soldiers looking for trouble, and a motley collection of hustlers, con artists, and lost souls.

"This place is scary in a lot of ways," Aeris murmured, her eyes wide as she took in the sights and sounds. "Especially for a girl. So we've got to find Tifa fast."

They navigated the crowded streets, their inquiries about Tifa met with leers, propositions, and vague directions. They passed the Honey Bee Inn, a notorious brothel, its entrance guarded by a leering redhead in a cheap suit. Johnny, the youth from Sector 7, was loitering nearby, his earlier bravado replaced by a nervous apprehension.

"Man... Should I go...... or not?" he muttered, wringing his hands. "I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!!" He spotted Cloud and Aeris. "Hey!! Aren't you...? What!! You mean you're... too?"

Cloud, not in the mood for Johnny’s theatrics, simply asked, "You know a girl named Tifa?"

The older man guarding the Honey Bee Inn overheard. "Hey, you're pretty fast. Tifa's our newest girl. But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now. Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion. Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride."

Don Corneo. The name sent a shiver of unease down Cloud’s spine. He was a powerful figure in Wall Market, a man known for his cruelty and insatiable appetites. Tifa, in Don Corneo’s mansion… It was a dangerous combination.

They hurried towards the mansion, a garish, ostentatious structure that loomed over the surrounding squalor. A burly doorman, his face a roadmap of cheap booze and bad decisions, blocked their path. "This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in Wall Market. Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again..." His gaze lingered on Aeris, a lecherous glint in his eyes. "Hey, and you got another cute one with you!"

Aeris stepped forward, her voice surprisingly firm. "Hey, this look's like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look. I'll tell Tifa about you." She started for the door.

"No!! You can't!!" Cloud exclaimed, grabbing her arm.

"Why?"

"You DO know... what kind of... place this is, don't you?"

Aeris’s eyes met his, a flicker of understanding in their depths. "Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?"

Cloud sighed, frustration warring with a reluctant admiration for her courage. "Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion. But, I just can't let you go in alone... Oh, man......"

Aeris suddenly burst out laughing, a bright, infectious sound that seemed to momentarily dispel the oppressive atmosphere of Wall Market. "Cloud, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way."

"WHAT!?" Cloud sputtered, his face flushing.

Before he could protest further, Aeris darted over to the doorman, her voice sweet and innocent. "Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring."

"Aeris! I can't......" Cloud began, but Aeris cut him off, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

"You ARE worried about Tifa, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!"

The doorman, his eyes glinting with anticipation, grinned. "A friend, huh...? Sounds pretty good to me. That'll make the Don happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can...... heeee, hee hee."

And so began Cloud’s unwilling descent into the surreal, cross-dressing labyrinth of Wall Market, his dignity sacrificed at the altar of Tifa’s safety. He found himself, much to his chagrin, being fitted for a dress at a surprisingly reputable clothing store, its owner, a flamboyant man with an eye for fashion, initially skeptical but eventually won over by Aeris’s persuasive charm (and a few strategically placed embellishments about Cloud’s secret desires).

Next came the wig, a cascade of blonde curls procured from a muscle-bound gym owner named "Beautiful Bro" after a grueling squat competition that left Cloud’s legs trembling but his pride, surprisingly, intact. Makeup was applied by a giggling gaggle of Honey Bee Inn girls, their ministrations transforming the stoic ex-SOLDIER into a surprisingly convincing, if somewhat bewildered, "Miss Cloud."

Aeris, meanwhile, had procured a stunning red dress, her own transformation from flower girl to femme fatale a testament to her chameleon-like adaptability. Together, they presented themselves at Don Corneo’s mansion, a vision of unexpected, if somewhat reluctant, glamour.

The doorman, his eyes practically popping out of his head, ushered them inside. "Damn!! Your friend's hot, too! Come in, come in!! Two ladies coming through!!"

The interior of the mansion was as garish and ostentatious as its exterior, a monument to Don Corneo’s vulgar taste and ill-gotten gains. A smarmy redhead in a cheap suit, presumably one of Corneo’s lackeys, greeted them with a lecherous grin. "Hey, ladies. I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't go wandering around..."

As soon as he disappeared, Aeris turned to Cloud, her voice urgent. "Now's our chance. Let's find Tifa. I wonder where she is..."

They found her in the basement, a dank, oppressive space that reeked of fear and desperation. Tifa was pacing nervously, her blue gown a stark contrast to the grimy surroundings. When she saw Cloud, her eyes widened in disbelief, then narrowed in a mixture of amusement and exasperation.

"Cloud!? Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!? Forget that, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?"

Cloud, feeling utterly ridiculous, grumbled, "Hey, give me a chance to answer. I'm dressed like this...... because there was no other way to get in here. I'm all right. Aeris helped me out."

Tifa’s gaze softened. "Oh, Aeris did..." She then explained her own predicament – Don Corneo was looking for a "bride," and Tifa had to be chosen to get close enough to question him about Shinra’s recent activities.

"If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?" Aeris interjected, her mind already working. "We have two here, right?"

Cloud groaned. "No, Aeris! I can't have you get involved."

"Oh? So it's all right for Tifa to be in danger?" Aeris countered, her eyes flashing.

Before Cloud could reply, Tifa chimed in, "Is it all right?"

Aeris smiled reassuringly. "I grew up in the slums... I'm used to danger. Do you trust me?"

Tifa nodded, a grateful smile gracing her lips. "Yes. Thanks, Ms. Aeris."

"Call me Aeris."

The smarmy redhead reappeared. "He---y!! It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting! I told you not to wander around... I tell ya, women nowadays... Hurry up, will ya!"

Cloud sighed, a sense of impending doom settling over him. "I probably don't need to ask but the other girl is...... Me...... right?"

Tifa’s lips twitched with suppressed amusement. "You're right, there was no need..."

"...to ask," Aeris finished, her eyes sparkling.

Tifa giggled. "Ha ha... You know, if you look closely, you're not so bad... I wonder what Barret would say if he could see you now..."

"They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry," Aeris urged, her voice regaining its urgency.

And so, Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris, an unlikely trio of would-be brides, ascended the stairs to face the infamous Don Corneo, their fates, and the fate of the Black Materia, hanging precariously in the balance.

<div id="chapter-7"></div>

# Chapter 7: Don Corneo's Audition

Don Corneo’s office was a monument to excess. Gaudy tapestries adorned the walls, plush velvet furniture competed for space with oversized, gilded statues, and the air hung thick with the cloying scent of cheap incense and unwashed power. The Don himself, a corpulent, leering man with small, piggish eyes and a disturbingly lascivious grin, sat enthroned behind a massive, ornate desk, flanked by two thuggish lackeys.

"All right, ladies! Line up in front of the Don!" Kotch, the smarmier of the two lackeys, barked, his eyes lingering a little too long on Cloud’s disguised form.

Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris arranged themselves before the desk, a bizarre tableau of reluctant beauty and simmering desperation. Don Corneo heaved himself to his feet, his jowls quivering with anticipation.

"Hmmm! Good, splendid!" he wheezed, his gaze sweeping over them. He waddled over to Aeris, his eyes appraising her with a disturbing intensity. "Now, let's see... Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---!" He moved on to Cloud, who stiffened, trying to maintain his composure under the Don’s unsettling scrutiny. "This one?" Corneo’s gaze then fell upon Tifa, and a slow, predatory smile spread across his face. "Or this one? Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!! My choice for tonight is......"

His fleshy finger landed on Tifa. "This little beauty!"

Tifa forced a coquettish smile. "Fu, fu, fu... Be nice, Don."

Corneo chortled, turning to his lackeys. "You can have the other ones!"

Kotch and Scotch, the other thug, grinned eagerly. "Yes, sir! Thank you sir!"

"Well then, shall we go my pretty!?" Corneo leered, already heading towards his private chambers. Tifa, her heart pounding, followed, casting a quick, reassuring glance back at Cloud and Aeris.

As soon as Corneo and Tifa disappeared, Kotch and Scotch closed in on Cloud and Aeris, their intentions unpleasantly clear. "Heh, heh... Well ladies, are we, uh, all ready?" Scotch sneered, his eyes glinting. "This is all thanks to the big boss, Don Corneo!"

The other thugs in the room, a motley collection of Corneo’s hangers-on, began to advance, their faces alight with crude anticipation. "Oh your eyes. They seem to... glow. I'm all yours, baby!" one of them slurred, reaching for Cloud.

Cloud’s patience snapped. "I ain't INTERESTED in a buncha scrubs like you!!" he roared, tearing off the ridiculous dress and wig, the Buster Sword appearing in his hand as if by magic.

The thugs recoiled, their lecherous grins replaced by expressions of shock and fear. "Wha... a MAN!???" Scotch sputtered. "God damn it! You think you can get away with this!? Get him! Knock the crap out of him!!"

The ensuing battle was short and brutal. Cloud, his movements a blur of Mako-enhanced speed and strength, dispatched the thugs with contemptuous ease, the Buster Sword a whirlwind of destruction. Scotch, despite his bluster, was no match for the ex-SOLDIER, and soon joined his cronies in a groaning heap on the floor.

Cloud turned to Aeris, who was watching with a mixture of awe and amusement. "Let's go help Tifa."

They raced towards Corneo’s private chambers, Aeris easily dispatching Kotch with a well-aimed shove down a flight of stairs. They burst into Corneo’s opulent bedroom just as the Don was making his move on Tifa.

"Aooooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes papa!!" Corneo wheezed, lunging for Tifa, who deftly sidestepped him, sending him sprawling onto the plush, velvet-covered bed.

"Cloud!!" Tifa cried, relief flooding her voice.

Corneo, his face a mask of bewildered rage, struggled to sit up. "Wha... what the hell? Who goes there!?"

Tifa, her eyes blazing with a cold fury, stepped forward. "You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?"

"Get what?"

The interrogation was swift and to the point. Tifa, her earlier coquettishness replaced by a steely determination, demanded answers. Cloud, his presence a silent, menacing threat, stood by her side. Aeris, her usual gentle demeanor hardened by a righteous anger, added her own pointed questions.

"What did your assistants find out?" Tifa pressed. "Talk! If you don't tell us..."

Cloud’s voice, cold and deadly, finished the threat. "...I'll chop them off."

Corneo, his bluster deflating like a punctured balloon, began to blubber. "No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything! I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do."

"By who?" Tifa demanded.

"No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!"

Aeris stepped forward, her voice surprisingly chilling. "...I'll rip them off."

"Waaaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra! Heidegger, the head of Public Safety Maintenance!" Corneo wailed.

Cloud’s eyes narrowed. "The head of Public Safety Maintenance!?"

Tifa pressed her advantage. "Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk! If you don't tell us..."

"...I'll smash them."

Corneo, thoroughly cowed, spilled everything. "Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout. And they're really going to crush them... literally. By breaking the support holding up the plate above them."

Tifa gasped, her face paling. "Break the support!?"

"You know what's going to happen?" Corneo continued, his voice trembling. "The plate'll go PING and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums... I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6."

"They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?" Tifa exclaimed, horror dawning in her eyes. She turned to Cloud, her voice urgent. "Cloud, will you come with me to Sector 7?"

Cloud nodded, his expression grim. "Of course, Tifa."

They started for the door, their mission to interrogate Corneo forgotten in the face of this new, far more terrible threat.

"Just a second!" Corneo called out, a desperate edge to his voice.

"Shut up!" Cloud snarled, not even bothering to turn around.

"No wait, it'll only take a second. How do you think scum like me feels when they babble on about the truth?"

Cloud paused, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. "They're sure they'll win."

Corneo’s face fell. "Woo-hoo! Right!" With a desperate lunge, he slammed his hand down on a hidden button on his desk. The floor beneath Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris opened up, and they plunged into the darkness below, the Don’s triumphant, wheezing laughter echoing after them.

# Chapter 8: Under a Falling Sky

The fall was jarring, a sudden, disorienting plunge into the stinking, Mako-tainted depths of the Midgar sewers. Cloud landed hard, the impact knocking the breath from him. Tifa and Aeris were already picking themselves up, their expressions a mixture of disgust and grim determination.

"Man! This is terrible," Tifa exclaimed, wiping a smear of grime from her cheek.

"Well, the worst is over..." Aeris began, but a low, guttural growl from the shadows cut her off. "...Maybe not..."

A massive, reptilian creature, Aps, Don Corneo’s monstrous pet, slithered into view, its eyes glowing with a malevolent hunger. The ensuing battle was a desperate, close-quarters affair, the confined space of the sewer tunnel amplifying the stench of stagnant water and Mako. But Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris, fueled by adrenaline and the urgency of their mission, fought with a savage intensity, their attacks slowly overwhelming the beast. Finally, with a gurgling roar, Aps collapsed, its massive form dissolving into the Lifestream.

They pressed on, their earlier disgust at their surroundings overshadowed by a gnawing fear. "It's too late......" Tifa whispered, her voice choked with despair. "Marlene... Barret... the people of the Slums."

Aeris, ever the optimist, tried to rally their spirits. "Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?"

Tifa nodded, a flicker of her usual resolve returning. ".........Yeah...... you're right! We still have time."

They navigated the treacherous sewer tunnels, emerging, finally, into the desolate, skeletal landscape of the Sector 7 Train Graveyard. The air here was heavy with the silence of forgotten things, the rusting hulks of abandoned trains looming like ancient, metallic beasts.

Cloud turned to Aeris, a rare note of apology in his voice. "Aeris. I got you mixed up in all of this..."

Aeris met his gaze, her Mako-green eyes unwavering. "Don't tell me to go home."

Tifa, her gaze fixed on the distant, ominous silhouette of the Sector 7 support pillar, urged them onward. "Let's see... If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here."

They wound their way through the graveyard, the silence broken only by the crunch of their boots on the gravel and the distant, mournful wail of the wind. They reached the Sector 7 train station, now eerily deserted, the station man their only encounter. "I heard a rumor that the plate was going to fall, crushing this station, I've worked at so many years," he said, his voice a hollow whisper. "But I just can't bear to leave here."

They raced on, their hearts pounding, towards the base of the pillar. A small crowd of anxious slum dwellers had gathered near the security fence, their faces pale with fear. The distinct sound of gunfire echoed from high above.

"We made it!" Tifa cried, relief flooding her voice. "The pillar's standing!"

Cloud’s head snapped up. "Wait! You hear something...... above us?"

Aeris’s eyes widened. "......gun fire?"

The camera, an unseen eye, panned upwards, revealing Barret at the very top of the pillar’s access stairs, his gun-arm blazing as he fought off a swarm of Shinra soldiers. Wedge was with him, but as they watched, he stumbled, his body tumbling from the platform, crashing to the ground near where Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris stood.

They rushed to his side. "Wedge!! You all right!?" Cloud exclaimed, kneeling beside the fallen AVALANCHE member.

Wedge coughed, a trickle of blood escaping his lips. "......Cloud...... You remembered...... my name." His voice was weak, his breathing shallow. "Barret's up top. ...help him...... An' Cloud... Sorry, I wasn't any help." His eyes fluttered closed.

Cloud’s jaw tightened. He stood, his gaze fixed on the top of the pillar. "I'm going up! Aeris! You look after Wedge."

Tifa turned to Aeris, her voice urgent. "Aeris, do me a favor. I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood. There's a little girl named Marlene there......"

Aeris nodded, her expression compassionate. "Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe."

Tifa then addressed the terrified crowd. "It's dangerous here! Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly! Everyone get out of Sector 7!" The crowd dispersed, their panicked cries swallowed by the rising wind.

Cloud and Tifa began their ascent, the metal stairs groaning under their weight. Halfway up, they found Biggs, leaning heavily against the railing, his face pale and drawn. "Cloud... so you don't care... what happens... to the... Planet?" he gasped.

Cloud hesitated. He still didn’t fully grasp AVALANCHE’s fanatical devotion to the Planet, but seeing Biggs, so clearly at death’s door, stirred something within him. "You're wounded......"

Biggs managed a weak smile. "Thanks, Cloud. ...don't worry 'bout me...... Barret's... fighting up there. Go help him..."

Further up, Jessie lay slumped against the wall, her breathing shallow, her eyes glazed with pain. "...Cloud... I'm glad...... I could talk with you... one last time."

"Don't say 'last'......" Cloud began, but Jessie shook her head, a faint smile on her lips.

"That's... all right... Because... of our actions... many...... people died...... this probably...... is our punishment..." Her voice trailed off, her eyes fluttering closed.

A cold fury, sharp and unexpected, coursed through Cloud. He pressed on, Tifa close behind, their hearts heavy with a shared grief and a burning resolve.

They reached the top of the pillar, emerging onto a windswept platform. Barret was still fighting, his gun-arm a whirlwind of destruction, but he was clearly outmatched. "Tifa! Cloud! You came!" he roared, relief evident in his voice. "Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter."

A sleek, black Shinra helicopter rose into view, its rotors beating a menacing rhythm against the darkening sky. Reno, his red hair whipping in the wind, leaped from the helicopter onto the platform, landing lightly on his feet. He ignored them, instead rushing to a control panel set into the pillar.

"You're too late," he sneered, his hand hovering over a large, red button. "Once I push this button..." He slammed his fist down. "That's all, folks! Mission accomplished."

"We have to disarm it!" Tifa cried, her voice frantic. "Cloud! Barret! Please!"

Reno turned, a cruel smile on his lips. "I can't have you do that. No one gets in the way of Reno and the Turks..."

The ensuing battle was a desperate, three-on-one affair. Reno was fast and agile, his attacks a blur of motion. He managed to trap Barret in a shimmering, pyramid-shaped energy field, but Cloud and Tifa, fighting with a synchronized fury, pressed their attack. Reno, clearly outmatched, glanced at his watch. "It's time." With a final, mocking salute, he leaped from the platform, disappearing into the abyss below.

Tifa rushed to the control panel, her fingers flying over the buttons. "Cloud! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!"

Barret, finally free from Reno’s trap, joined her. "DAMN! It's a time bomb!"

Cloud examined the device, his brow furrowed in concentration. "...It's not a normal time bomb."

The Shinra helicopter reappeared, Tseng, the stoic leader of the Turks, visible on its side rig. And behind him, her hands bound, her face pale but defiant, was Aeris.

"That's right," Tseng called out, his voice amplified by the helicopter’s speakers. "You'll have a hard time disarming that one. It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it."

"Please, stop it!" Tifa pleaded, her voice choked with despair.

Tseng laughed, a cold, humorless sound. "Ha ha ha...... Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System."

Barret roared in frustration, firing a wild shot at the helicopter. Tseng remained unfazed. "I wouldn't try that...... You just might make me injure our special guest." Aeris lifted her head, her gaze meeting theirs, a silent plea in her eyes. Barret reluctantly lowered his gun-arm.

"Aeris!!" Tifa cried, her voice a mixture of anguish and disbelief.

"Oh, you know each other?" Tseng mused, his tone mocking. "How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me."

"What are you gonna do with Aeris!?" Cloud demanded, his voice tight with a cold fury.

"I haven't decided. Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient. It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President."

Aeris leaned forward, her voice surprisingly strong. "Tifa, don't worry! She's all right!" Tseng, his patience clearly wearing thin, turned and slapped Aeris, sending her reeling.

"Aeris!" Tifa screamed.

"Hurry and get out!" Aeris yelled, her voice defiant despite the blow.

Tseng chuckled. "Ha, ha, ha... Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?" The helicopter veered away, disappearing into the Mako-stained sky, just as the first explosions rocked the pillar. The massive structure groaned, a sound like a dying beast, and began to tilt.

"Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!" Tifa cried, her eyes wide with terror.

They scrambled for an escape route, their options dwindling with each passing second. Barret, with a desperate lunge, grabbed hold of a thick cable attached to the platform. "Yo, we can use this wire to get out!"

They clambered onto the cable, a fragile lifeline in the midst of the chaos, and swung out into the abyss just as the Sector 7 plate, a monstrous slab of steel and concrete, tore free from its moorings and began its catastrophic descent, a silent, terrifying harbinger of the destruction to come. The sky, it seemed, was indeed falling.

<div id="chapter-9"></div>

# Chapter 9: Shinra's Tower of Secrets

The fall of the Sector 7 plate was a cataclysm, a man-made disaster that shook Midgar to its very core. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret landed, bruised and battered, in the Sector 6 playground, the once-familiar landmark now a scene of devastation, littered with smoking debris and the stench of death. The air was thick with a choking dust, the cries of the injured and the dying a mournful chorus against the backdrop of crumbling buildings and shifting earth.

"Marlene! MARLENE!!" Barret roared, his voice a raw, anguished cry that tore through the chaos. He stumbled through the wreckage, his eyes wild with a desperate, paternal fear. "MAR---LE---NE!! Biggs! Wedge!! Jessie!! Goddamn it!!! Dammit! DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!!! What the hell's it all for!?" He fell to his knees, his massive frame shaking with uncontrollable sobs, his gun-arm firing uselessly at the rubble, a futile expression of his grief and rage.

Cloud and Tifa rushed to his side, their own hearts heavy with loss. "Barret, stop... Please stop, Barret," Tifa pleaded, her voice gentle but firm.

Barret eventually collapsed, his fury spent, leaving only a hollow, aching despair. They sat amidst the ruins, the weight of their failure, of the lives lost, pressing down on them.

"Marlene..." Barret whispered, his voice hoarse.

Tifa’s eyes, usually so bright, were dull with unshed tears. "......... Barret......? Marlene is... I think Marlene is safe."

Barret looked up, a flicker of hope in his tear-filled eyes. "......huh?"

"Right before they took Aeris," Tifa explained, "she said, 'Don't worry, she's all right.' She was probably talking about Marlene."

A small measure of relief washed over Barret, but it was quickly overshadowed by the crushing weight of his other losses. "Biggs...... Wedge... Jessie......"

Cloud’s voice was flat, devoid of emotion. "All three of them were in the pillar."

"Think I don't know that?" Barret snapped, his grief resurfacing. "But... we, all of us fought together. I don't wanna think of them as dead!"

"...and the other people in Sector 7," Tifa added, her voice barely a whisper.

"This is all screwed up!" Barret raged, his fist clenching. "They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people..."

Tifa’s gaze was troubled. "...are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?"

"No, Tifa!" Barret insisted, his voice thick with conviction. "That ain't it! Hell no!! It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra! They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to... build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold! If we don't get rid of them, they're gonna kill this planet! Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!"

Tifa looked away, her expression uncertain. ".........I don't know."

"What don't you know!?" Barret demanded. "You don't believe me?"

"It's not that. I'm not sure about... me. My feelings."

Barret turned to Cloud, his gaze searching. "An' what about you?"

Cloud remained silent, his Mako-infused eyes fixed on some distant, unseen point. He turned and began to walk away, towards Sector 5, towards Aeris’s home.

"Yo! Where's he think he's goin'?" Barret exclaimed, bewildered.

Tifa’s eyes widened in understanding. "Oh! Aeris!"

"Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?"

"...I don't really know... But she's the one I left Marlene with."

"Damn! Marlene!!" Barret started after Cloud, then paused, turning back to Tifa. "Tifa. There ain't no turnin' back now." He ran off, his massive frame disappearing into the dust and gloom. Tifa hesitated for a moment, then, with a final, sorrowful glance at the ruins of Sector 7, she followed.

They found Cloud already making his way through the ravaged streets of Sector 6. "Cloud!" Tifa called out, her voice urgent. He stopped, waiting for them to catch up.

"Take me to Marlene!" Barret demanded, his voice still rough with grief.

Tifa turned to Cloud, her gaze questioning. "You're going to help Aeris?"

Cloud nodded. "Yeah... But before that, there's something I want to know."

"What's that?"

"...it's about the Ancients." The word hung in the air, heavy with unspoken implications. Suddenly, Cloud stumbled, clutching his head, a sharp, searing pain lancing through his skull. An image, vivid and disturbing, flashed before his eyes – Sephiroth, his silver hair flowing, his eyes burning with an unholy light, his voice a chilling whisper: _In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!_

"Sephiroth...?" Cloud gasped, his voice a strangled whisper. He fell to one knee, the world around him tilting and blurring.

"Are you all right?" Tifa cried, rushing to his side.

Barret, his earlier grief momentarily forgotten, grabbed Cloud’s arm, hauling him to his feet. "Pull it together, man!"

Cloud shook his head, trying to clear the lingering echoes of Sephiroth’s voice. The Ancients… Sephiroth… Aeris… The pieces were beginning to fall into place, forming a picture that was both terrifying and strangely familiar. He had to find Aeris. He had to know the truth.

---

They reached Aeris’s house in Sector 5, a small beacon of hope amidst the surrounding devastation. Elmyra, Aeris’s adoptive mother, greeted them at the door, her face etched with a weary resignation.

"Cloud...... wasn't it?" she said, her voice tired. "It's about Aeris, isn't it?"

Cloud nodded, his heart heavy. "...Sorry. The Shinra have her."

Elmyra’s gaze was unwavering. "I know. They took her from here."

"They were here?"

"That's what Aeris wanted..."

"Why is Shinra after Aeris?" Cloud pressed, a sense of urgency gnawing at him.

Elmyra sighed, a sound like the rustling of dry leaves. "Aeris is an Ancient. The sole survivor."

Barret’s eyes widened in disbelief. "...What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?"

"Not her real mother," Elmyra explained, her voice tinged with a deep, abiding sorrow. She recounted the story of Aeris’s arrival in Midgar, fifteen years prior, during the Wutai war. How she had found Aeris and her dying mother, Ifalna, at the Sector 7 train station. How Ifalna, with her last breath, had entrusted Aeris to Elmyra’s care, revealing that Aeris was a Cetra, one of the last of an ancient, mystical race who were said to be able to commune with the Planet itself.

She spoke of Aeris’s mysterious powers, her ability to hear the voices of the Planet, of the spirits of the departed. And she told them of Tseng’s arrival, of Shinra’s relentless pursuit of Aeris, their belief that she, as the last Ancient, held the key to the Promised Land, a mythical place of boundless Mako energy.

"It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years..." Cloud mused, a newfound respect for Aeris’s resilience dawning in his eyes.

"The Shinra needed her," Elmyra explained, "So I guess they wouldn't harm her."

"But why now......" Tifa began, her voice laced with concern.

"She brought a little girl here with her," Elmyra continued, her gaze drifting towards the stairs. "On the way here, Tseng found them. She probably couldn't get away fast enough. She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety."

Cloud’s blood ran cold. "Must be Marlene."

Barret’s face, already etched with grief, contorted in fresh anguish. "Marlene!! Aeris was caught because of Marlene!? I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm... really... sorry..."

Elmyra’s gaze softened with a hint of understanding. "You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?" Then, seeing the raw pain in Barret’s eyes, she relented. "She's upstairs asleep. Why don't you go and see her."

Barret stumbled towards the stairs, his massive frame shaking with a mixture of relief and guilt. Tifa, her own eyes filled with remorse, murmured, "It's my fault... I was the one who got Aeris involved in this."

"Don't say that," Elmyra said gently. "Aeris doesn't think that."

Barret reappeared, Marlene cradled in his arms, her small face buried in his shoulder. He turned to Cloud and Tifa, his expression a mixture of determination and despair. "Cloud! You gonna go help Aeris, right? She's done so much for me... If it's the Shinra you're dealin' with, I can't just sit here! I'm comin', too!"

Marlene, peeking out from behind Barret’s arm, piped up, "Guess what? Guess what? Aeris was asking me lots of questions. Like what kind of person Cloud is. I bet she likes you, Cloud!"

Cloud, caught off guard, muttered, "I don't know." Marlene giggled, a small, innocent sound in the midst of their grim reality.

Cloud turned to Tifa. "We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. ...You gotta be prepared for the worst."

Tifa met his gaze, her own resolve hardening. "I know. Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit. If I stayed here... I'll go crazy."

They prepared to leave, their mission clear: infiltrate Shinra Headquarters, rescue Aeris, and confront whatever secrets lay hidden within its towering, Mako-powered walls. The fate of the Planet, and their own intertwined destinies, hung in the balance.

Cloud, Tifa, and Barret made their way through the Sector 6 Wall Market, their earlier, more frivolous visit now a distant memory. The garish lights and desperate revelry seemed a cruel mockery of the devastation that had befallen Sector 7. Their destination: the Shinra Building, a towering monument to corporate greed and unchecked power, its upper floors shrouded in a perpetual Mako haze.

"Hey, you oughta know this building well," Barret grunted, addressing Cloud.

Cloud shook his head. "...Not really, now that I think about it. This's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters."

"I heard about this place before," Barret continued. "Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees. Must be where they took Aeris. The security's pretty light now. Awright, let's go!!"

Tifa, ever the pragmatist, interjected, "Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?"

Barret scoffed. "Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......"

"That's not going to work!" Tifa insisted. "We've got to find another way..."

"Ain't gonna be no other way!" Barret retorted. "If we keep wastin' time like this, Aeris'll..."

"I know that!" Tifa snapped. "But if we get caught here..." She turned to Cloud, her gaze imploring. "Hey, Cloud. ...What should we do?"

Cloud considered their options. A frontal assault was suicide. But a stealthy approach? "Let's sneak in quietly," he decided. Tifa nodded in agreement. Barret, grumbling but ultimately conceding to their logic, followed as they found a side entrance, a narrow, unassuming doorway that promised a less conspicuous, if more arduous, path into the heart of the Shinra empire.

The climb was a seemingly endless ascent up a narrow, dimly lit stairwell, each flight of stairs a testament to Shinra’s towering ambition. Barret, his patience wearing thin, grumbled, "Yo! You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?"

Tifa, her breath coming in ragged gasps, retorted, "Well, we've got to get to Aeris to help her somehow."

"Talk about out of the way..." Barret muttered.

Cloud, his own Mako-enhanced stamina beginning to wane, found himself reflecting on the irony of their situation. He, who had once aspired to be a part of SOLDIER, was now scaling the very building that housed its creators, his former allegiances a distant, muddled memory. "I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved Aeris," he admitted, more to himself than to the others. "I should have known that was impossible though..."

Barret chuckled, a low, rumbling sound. "Heh, heh, heh."

Cloud shot him a wary glance. "What is it? You're givin' me the willies."

"So there are times when even you fight for other people," Barret observed, a note of grudging respect in his voice. "I am impressed."

"Who cares if you're impressed...?" Cloud retorted, though a faint warmth spread through him at Barret’s unexpected acknowledgement.

They pressed on, their weary limbs protesting with each step, their resolve fueled by a shared determination to rescue Aeris and confront the secrets that lay hidden within Shinra’s towering fortress.

<div id="chapter-10"></div>

# Chapter 10: Flight from Midgar

After an agonizing climb that tested the limits of their endurance, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret finally reached the 59th floor of the Shinra Building. The air here was cleaner, the lighting brighter, a stark contrast to the oppressive gloom of the lower levels and the slums they had left behind. But the atmosphere was no less tense, the silence heavy with the unspoken threat of discovery.

A pair of Shinra guards, their faces impassive, blocked the elevators. "Destroy the intruders!" one of them barked, his hand already reaching for his weapon. The ensuing battle was swift and brutal, Cloud’s SOLDIER training and Mako-enhanced strength making short work of the hapless guards. One of them dropped a keycard – "Keycard 60" – their first tangible step towards reaching Aeris.

The 60th floor was a maze of corridors and surveillance rooms, a testament to Shinra’s obsession with control. They managed to evade the patrolling guards, their movements silent and coordinated, a grim ballet of infiltration and desperation. On the 61st floor, a lounge area for Shinra employees, a surprisingly helpful man, mistaking them for a repair crew, handed over "Keycard 62," complaining about a stuck door.

The 62nd floor housed the Mayor's office and the Shinra libraries. Mayor Domino, a portly, ineffectual man who seemed more interested in word games than governance, challenged them to guess a password in exchange for his keycard. With the help of his long-suffering deputy, Hart, and a series of increasingly expensive "hints," they managed to decipher the password – a randomly generated word like "MAKO" or "BEST" – and obtained "Keycard 65" and a bonus "Elemental" Materia from the gleeful, if somewhat pathetic, Mayor.

The 63rd and 64th floors were a blur of minor puzzles, more guards, and the unsettling discovery of a "Megaphone" in a locker room, a strange, incongruous item that Cloud pocketed without comment. The 65th floor housed a massive, intricate model of Midgar, its missing pieces scattered throughout the room. By carefully reassembling the model, they unlocked a hidden compartment containing "Keycard 66."

The 66th floor was dominated by a large, opulent conference room. Several Shinra executives were milling about, their hushed conversations and anxious glances a clear indication that something was amiss. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret, their disguises – if they could even be called that – holding by a thread, managed to slip into the bathroom unnoticed. Cloud, spotting a ventilation shaft, hoisted himself up, the others following.

They crawled through the cramped, dusty shafts, emerging above the conference room, where President Shinra and his top executives – Reeve, Palmer, Scarlet, Heidegger, and a gaunt, sinister-looking man Cloud didn't recognize – were gathered around a massive mahogany table.

"...the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil..." Reeve, the head of Urban Development, was saying, his voice tight with concern. "The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is..."

"We're not rebuilding," President Shinra interjected, his voice cold and decisive. "We're leaving Sector 7 as it is. And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan."

Reeve’s face paled. "...then the Ancients?"

"The Promised Land will soon be ours," the President declared, a predatory gleam in his eyes. "I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area."

Palmer, the portly, sycophantic head of the Space Program, clapped his hands gleefully. "Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space Program in the budget!"

Reeve protested, "Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence..."

"It'll be all right," the President reassured him, his voice oozing a chilling confidence. "The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more."

Heidegger, the brutish head of Public Safety, guffawed. "Ha ha ha! After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!"

Barret, watching from the vent above, growled, a low, guttural sound of pure, unadulterated rage.

The President then turned to the gaunt man. "Hojo. How's the girl?"

Hojo, his eyes glittering with a disturbing intensity, replied, "As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18%."

"How long will the research take?"

"Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter. That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time."

The President’s gaze sharpened. "What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?"

Hojo chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong... and yet has her weaknesses." He giggled, a sound that sent a shiver of revulsion down Cloud’s spine.

"That concludes our meeting," the President announced, rising from his chair. The executives began to disperse, Scarlet pausing to sniff the air. "Something stinks..." she commented, before following the others out of the room.

Cloud, Tifa, and Barret exchanged horrified glances. Breeding Aeris? The sheer audacity, the cold, clinical cruelty of Hojo’s plan, was staggering. "They were talking about Aeris... right?" Cloud whispered, his voice tight with a mixture of anger and disbelief.

They scrambled back through the ventilation shafts, emerging into the now-empty bathroom. Hojo was just leaving the conference room, and they followed him at a discreet distance, their hearts pounding with a shared sense of urgency. He led them to the 67th floor, Hojo’s private laboratory, a place of sterile efficiency and unspoken horrors.

"I remember him," Barret muttered, his voice a low growl. "That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. Cloud, don't you know him?"

Cloud shook his head. "This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So... that's what he looks like..."

They crept through the laboratory, their senses assailed by the cloying stench of chemicals and Mako. In the center of the main chamber, a large glass tank held a creature that looked like a lion, but with fur the color of fire and eyes that burned with an unnatural intelligence. Hojo approached the tank, his hand caressing the glass. "My precious specimen..." he murmured, before turning and disappearing into an adjoining room.

Tifa approached the tank, her face a mask of pity and disgust. "Precious specimen...? Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?"

Cloud, however, was drawn to another, even larger tank in the corner of the room. He peered through the glass, and his blood ran cold. Inside, suspended in a sickly green Mako solution, was a headless, vaguely humanoid figure, its flesh pale and bloated. "Jenova..." he whispered, the name a venomous hiss on his lips. A searing pain lanced through his skull, and he stumbled, clutching his head, the world around him blurring into a crimson haze. _Jenova… Sephiroth…_ The names, the images, a maelstrom of fragmented memories and raw, unadulterated hatred, threatened to overwhelm him.

"Jenova... Sephiroth's..." he gasped, struggling to regain his composure. "So... they've brought it here."

Tifa rushed to his side, her hand on his arm. "Cloud, be strong!"

"Did you see it?" Barret asked, his voice hushed. "Where's its $\#&\*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'."

They ascended a flight of stairs to an upper level, where Hojo stood before another glass tank. And inside, her face pale but her eyes defiant, was Aeris.

"Aeris!" Cloud cried, his voice a mixture of relief and alarm.

Hojo turned, his expression one of mild annoyance. "Aeris? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?"

"We're taking Aeris back."

"Outsiders......" Hojo mused, his gaze dismissive.

Barret, his patience exhausted, lunged forward, his gun-arm aimed at Hojo’s head. "Shoulda noticed it earlier, you..."

Hojo remained unfazed. "Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should. The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?"

Cloud’s jaw tightened. "Ugh."

"That's right," Hojo continued, a smug smile on his lips. "I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves. Now, bring in the Specimen!"

An elevator within Aeris’s tank whirred to life, bringing the fiery lion-creature up to join her. It snarled, its eyes fixed on Aeris, who pounded on the glass, her voice a desperate plea. "Cloud, help!"

"What do you think you're doin'?" Cloud demanded, his hand instinctively reaching for the Buster Sword.

Hojo chuckled. "Lending a helping hand to an endangered species... Both of them are on the brink of extinction... If I don't help, all these animals will disappear."

Tifa’s eyes blazed with indignation. "...animal? That's terrible! Aeris is a human being!"

"You're gonna pay!" Barret roared.

"Barret! Can't you do anything?" Cloud urged.

"Awright!! Step back!" Barret took aim at the glass tank.

"Stop!!" Hojo shrieked, but it was too late. Barret’s gun-arm roared, and the glass shattered, a cascade of Mako solution and glittering shards. The lion-creature leaped out, pouncing on Hojo, its claws tearing at his lab coat.

"Now's our chance to get Aeris!" Cloud yelled, rushing into the now-empty tank. Aeris, her face a mixture of relief and gratitude, ran out to join Tifa and Barret. Cloud started to follow, then paused, a strange premonition washing over him.

"Cloud... what's wrong?" Tifa asked, her voice laced with concern.

"...The elevator is moving."

Hojo, struggling to free himself from the lion-creature’s grasp, shrieked, "This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!"

The lion-creature, its Mako-infused eyes burning with an unexpected intelligence, turned to face them. "He's rather strong," it said, its voice a low, surprisingly cultured growl. "I'll help you all out."

Tifa gasped. "It talked!?"

"I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss," the creature replied, its gaze fixed on Hojo’s newest experiment, a grotesque, multi-limbed monstrosity that was now emerging from the shattered tank.

"We'll take care of that monster," Cloud declared, his gaze fixed on the abomination. He glanced at Tifa. "Tifa, I'm countin' on you! Take Aeris somewhere safe."

Tifa nodded, leading Aeris away from the ensuing battle.

"What's your name?" Cloud asked the lion-creature, as they prepared to face Hojo’s latest creation.

"Hojo has named me, Red XIII," the creature replied, its voice laced with a weary disdain. "A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish."

"Come on!" Cloud yelled, and together, the ex-SOLDIER and the enigmatic Red XIII charged into battle.

The fight was short but brutal. Hojo’s creation, though formidable, was no match for their combined strength. As the monster dissolved into the Lifestream, Aeris and Tifa rejoined them.

"Aeris, you all right?" Cloud asked, his gaze softening as he looked at the flower girl.

Tifa, however, was still eyeing Red XIII with a mixture of awe and suspicion. "She seems all right, ...in many ways."

Red XIII huffed, a sound like wind whistling through a canyon. "I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things."

Barret, who had been silently observing the exchange, finally spoke. "What are you?"

"An informed question," Red XIII replied, his Mako-green eyes glinting with an ancient wisdom. "But difficult to answer. I am what you see. ...You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way."

Aeris smiled at Cloud, a genuine, heartfelt expression. "Cloud... so you did come for me."

Red XIII, his earlier aloofness replaced by a surprising courtliness, bowed his head. "I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard......"

"Now we've saved Aeris, ain't no need to be in this buildin'!" Barret declared, his usual bluster returning. "So let's get the hell outta here!"

But their escape was short-lived. As they reached the 66th floor elevator, Rude, of the Turks, stepped out, his face a mask of cold professionalism. Tseng emerged behind him, his expression unreadable.

"It must have been a real thrill for you..." Tseng said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Did you enjoy it?"

Cloud’s hand tightened on the hilt of the Buster Sword. "Ggh..."

Their capture was swift and efficient. They were disarmed and escorted to the 70th floor, President Shinra’s private office, where they found Aeris, her hands bound, her face pale but defiant.

"You all got caught, too?" Cloud asked, his voice tight with frustration. "Where is Aeris!?" he demanded, though he already knew the answer.

President Shinra, his face a mask of cold amusement, gestured towards Aeris. "In a safe place. She's the last surviving Ancient... Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history."

Red XIII’s ears perked up. "Cetra... That girl, is she a survivor of the Cetra?"

"Cetra, or the Ancients will show us the way to the 'Promised Land,'" the President continued, his eyes glittering with avarice. "I'm expecting a lot out of her."

"The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?" Red XIII scoffed.

"Even so, it's just too appealing to not to pursue. It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile. ...If the land is fertile..."

Barret’s eyes narrowed. "Then there's gotta be Mako!"

"Exactly," the President confirmed, a smug smile on his lips. "That is why our money sucking Mako Reactor is necessary. The abundant Mako will just come out on its own. That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory..."

"@$\#\*^%\! Quit dreamin'!" Barret roared.

"Oh really, don't you know?" the President retorted, his voice laced with a chilling condescension. "These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power. Well, that is all for our meeting."

Rude gestured towards the door. "Come on! Outta his way!"

Cloud, Tifa, and Red XIII turned to leave, their hearts heavy with a sense of impending doom. Barret, however, hung back, his face a mask of defiant rage. "Hold it! I got a lot I wanna say to you!" He started towards the President, but Rude, with surprising strength, dragged him away.

"If you need something else..." the President called after them, his voice dripping with sarcasm, "talk to my secretary."

They were herded into a detainment area, each confined to a separate, sterile cell. Cloud found himself sharing a cell with Tifa, Barret with Red XIII, and Aeris, alone, in a cell across the corridor. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the distant hum of the Shinra Building’s machinery and the occasional, guttural growl from Barret’s cell.

"Psst (Can we get out?)" Tifa whispered, her eyes wide with a mixture of fear and determination.

Cloud surveyed their surroundings, his mind already racing, searching for a weakness, an escape route. "Leave it to me," he whispered back, though a knot of unease tightened in his stomach. This was Shinra’s stronghold. Escape would not be easy.

He could hear Barret muttering in the adjacent cell, trying to piece together the fragmented information they had gleaned. "Hey! Aeris is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra. The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land... The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy... Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy... and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker. I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin' new members!! Me, Tifa, Cloud... and Aeris too." He turned to Red XIII. "How 'bout you?" Red XIII remained silent, turning away to lie down on his cot. "You're so damn boring," Barret grumbled.

Across the corridor, Aeris’s voice, soft but clear, reached Cloud. "Cloud, are you there?"

"Aeris!? You safe?"

"Yeah, I'm all right. I knew that Cloud would come for me."

"Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?"

Aeris giggled, a sound like wind chimes in the sterile silence. "The deal was for one date, right?"

Tifa, who had been lying on her cot, her eyes closed, sat up abruptly. "............oh, I get it."

Aeris’s voice, now tinged with a hint of embarrassment, replied, "...!? Tifa! Tifa, you're there too!"

"EXCUSE me," Tifa said, her voice carefully neutral. "You know, Aeris. I have a question."

"What?"

"Does the Promised Land really exist?"

Aeris hesitated. "...I don't know. All I know is... The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet. And...... then... The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness."

"...What does that mean?" Tifa pressed.

"More than words...... I don't know."

Cloud’s mind reeled. Speak with the Planet? The Promised Land? It all sounded like something out of a child’s fairytale. Yet, there was a conviction in Aeris’s voice, a certainty that resonated deep within him.

"You hear it now?" he asked, his voice hushed.

"I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums," Aeris replied. "Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is... my real mother. Someday I'll get out of Midgar... Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land. ...That's what mom said. I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but..."

Cloud sighed, a wave of exhaustion washing over him. "Let's just get some sleep." He lay back on his cot, the hard metal unforgiving beneath him, and closed his eyes, the mysteries of the Ancients, the threat of Shinra, and the enigmatic allure of the Promised Land swirling in his mind, a chaotic prelude to an uncertain dawn.

He woke abruptly, a sense of unease prickling his skin. The cell door was open. Tifa was still asleep on her cot. How…? He crept out into the corridor. The guard lay slumped against the wall, his eyes wide and unseeing, a dark stain spreading across his uniform. A trail of blood, fresh and glistening, led down the corridor towards Hojo’s laboratory.

"Tifa... Wake up!" Cloud hissed, shaking her gently. She sat up, her eyes still clouded with sleep. "Something's wrong. Look outside."

Tifa’s gasp was a sharp intake of breath as she saw the dead guard. "I wonder what happened..."

"He should have the key on him..." Cloud began, then his eyes widened in horror as he remembered. "Jenova…!" He turned to Tifa, his voice urgent. "Come on, Tifa, get Aeris. I'll go help Barret and the others."

They freed the others, the grim scene in the corridor a stark testament to the horror that had been unleashed. "No human could've done this," Red XIII rumbled, his Mako-green eyes narrowed in suspicion. He darted off, following the trail of blood.

They found him in Hojo’s laboratory, standing before the shattered remains of Jenova’s tank. A gaping, bloody hole had been ripped in the reinforced glass, and the trail of blood led towards the specimen elevator. "Jenova Specimen..." Red XIII murmured. "Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens."

They followed the gruesome trail to the 70th floor, President Shinra’s opulent office. And there, slumped across his massive mahogany desk, was President Shinra, impaled by a ridiculously long, impossibly sharp katana. Sephiroth’s Masamune.

Barret’s jaw dropped. "He's dead... The leader of Shinra, Inc. is dead..."

Tifa rushed behind the desk, her eyes wide with a dawning horror. "Then this sword must be...!?"

Cloud’s voice was a strangled whisper. "Sephiroth's!!"

Tifa’s gaze met his, her own fear mirroring his own. "...Sephiroth is alive?"

"Looks like it," Cloud confirmed, his hand instinctively reaching for the hilt of the Buster Sword. "Only Sephiroth can use that sword."

"Who cares who did it!?" Barret exclaimed, a mixture of shock and grim satisfaction on his face. "This is the end of the Shinra now!"

A terrified yelp from behind a nearby pillar made them all jump. Palmer, the portly, sycophantic head of Shinra’s defunct Space Program, emerged, his face a mask of terror. "Uh!" He tried to flee, but Cloud and Barret quickly intercepted him.

"P, p, p, please, don't kill me!" Palmer blubbered.

"What happened?" Cloud demanded.

"Se... Sephiroth. Sephiroth came."

Cloud’s grip tightened on Palmer’s arm. "Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?"

"Yeah, I saw him! I saw him with my own eyes! Um, he was saying something about not letting us have the Promised Land."

Tifa’s eyes widened. "Then what? Does that mean that the Promised Land really exists and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?"

Barret frowned. "So he's a good guy then?"

Cloud shook his head, his Mako-infused eyes burning with an unholy light. "Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!! It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!"

Palmer, seizing the opportunity, wriggled free and darted towards the door, just as the distinct sound of a helicopter approaching filled the air.

"Rufus! &\*%$\! I forgot about him!" Barret cursed.

"Who's that?" Tifa asked, her gaze fixed on the helicopter as it hovered outside the shattered window.

"Vice President Rufus. The President's son. I heard that he's been assigned somewhere else for a long time..."

They rushed outside onto the helipad, where Rufus Shinra, his face a mask of cold, aristocratic disdain, was already disembarking, Palmer babbling a hasty report at his side.

"So... Sephiroth was actually here," Rufus mused, his gaze sweeping over them. "...By the way. Who are you guys?"

Cloud stepped forward, his hand on the hilt of the Buster Sword. "I'm Cloud, former SOLDIER First Class!"

Barret, Tifa, Aeris, and Red XIII each declared their allegiances, their voices a chorus of defiance against the new President of Shinra.

Rufus’s lips curved into a smirk. "What a crew. Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc."

"You only President, 'cause yer old man died!" Barret retorted.

"That's right," Rufus conceded, his voice smooth and dangerous. "I'll let you hear my new appointment speech. ...Old man tried to control the world with money. It seems to have been working. The population thought that Shinra would protect them. Work at Shinra, get your pay. If a terrorist attacks, the Shinra army will help you. It looks perfect on the outside. But, I do things differently. I'll control the world with fear. It takes too much to do it like my old man. A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste money on them."

Tifa scoffed. "He likes to make speeches just like his father."

Cloud turned to Barret, his voice urgent. "Get outta this building with Aeris!"

"What?"

"I'll explain later! Barret! This is the real crisis for the Planet!"

"The hell's that supposed to mean?"

"I'll tell you later! Just take my word for it now! I'll go after I take care of him!"

Barret hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "Awright, Cloud!" He, Tifa, Aeris, and Red XIII retreated back into the building, leaving Cloud alone to face Rufus.

"Why do you want to fight me?" Rufus asked, his tone one of mild curiosity.

"You seek the Promised Land and Sephiroth," Cloud stated, his gaze unwavering.

"Hm, exactly. Mm? Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?"

Cloud’s eyes narrowed. "...A lot has happened. Anyway, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!"

Rufus chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. "I see. I guess this means we won't become friends."

The ensuing battle was a desperate, one-on-one duel, Rufus’s agility and marksmanship a surprising match for Cloud’s Mako-enhanced strength. But Cloud, fueled by a burning desire to protect Aeris and unravel the mystery of Sephiroth, fought with a savage intensity, eventually forcing Rufus to retreat.

"Heh... That's all for today..." Rufus sneered, grabbing hold of the helicopter as it swooped down to retrieve him. He disappeared into the Mako-stained sky, leaving Cloud alone on the helipad, the weight of their newfound knowledge, and the terrifying implications of Sephiroth’s return, pressing down on him.

He rejoined the others on the first floor, the lobby now a scene of chaos, Shinra soldiers and panicked employees scrambling for cover. "I'll go on ahead!" Barret yelled, already charging towards the main entrance, his gun-arm blazing. He quickly returned, his face grim. "\*&^%(\*... surrounded, huh?"

"You all get out while you can," Aeris urged, her voice surprisingly calm. "It's not you they're after... it's me."

"Yeah, well that ain't happenin'," Barret retorted, his loyalty, however grudging, unwavering. "You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to watch out for you! Ok, playtime's over for you jackasses..."

Their escape was a desperate, running battle through the streets of Midgar, Shinra soldiers swarming them at every turn. They commandeered a Shinra truck, Cloud taking the wheel of a motorcycle, his Buster Sword a whirlwind of destruction as he cleared a path through the pursuing forces. They reached the edge of the city, the vast, desolate wasteland stretching before them, but their escape was cut short by the appearance of a massive, armored tank/robot, its cannons already swiveling to target them.

The battle was fierce, the robot’s arsenal of weapons a relentless barrage. But Cloud and his companions, fighting with a desperate courage, managed to disable the mechanical monstrosity, its metallic frame collapsing in a shower of sparks and twisted metal.

They stood at the edge of Midgar, the city a distant, oppressive silhouette against the horizon, the wasteland stretching before them, a barren, Mako-scarred testament to Shinra’s rapacious greed.

"Well, what do we do now?" Barret asked, his voice heavy with a weary uncertainty.

Cloud’s gaze was fixed on the distant, northern mountains. "Sephiroth is alive. I... I have to settle the score."

"And that'll save the Planet?" Barret pressed.

Cloud hesitated. "...Seems like it."

Barret nodded, a grim determination in his eyes. "Awright, I'm going!"

Aeris stepped forward, her Mako-green eyes filled with a quiet resolve. "I'll go too. ...I have things that I want to find out."

"About the Ancients?" Cloud asked.

Aeris smiled, a hint of mystery in her expression. "......Many things."

Tifa’s gaze lingered on Midgar, a mixture of sorrow and anger in her eyes. "I guess this's good bye, Midgar."

Red XIII, his fiery mane bristling in the wind, declared, "I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that."

Cloud looked at his companions, a strange mixture of ex-SOLDIER, eco-terrorists, a flower girl with an ancient lineage, and a talking, fire-maned beast. An unlikely alliance, bound together by a shared enemy and a desperate hope. "Then..." he began, but paused, searching for the right words. "Let's go!"

He turned and began to walk towards the northeast, towards the town of Kalm, towards the truth that lay hidden in his own fragmented memories, and towards the inevitable confrontation with Sephiroth, the man who had shattered his world, and now threatened to destroy the Planet itself. The journey had just begun.

<div id="chapter-11"></div>

# Chapter 11: The Nibelheim Incident

The journey from the desolate outskirts of Midgar to the quiet town of Kalm was a grim, contemplative affair. The barren landscape, a stark testament to Shinra's rapacious Mako extraction, did little to lift their spirits. Cloud, burdened by the weight of his fragmented memories and the chilling reappearance of Sephiroth, walked in a brooding silence, his Mako-infused eyes scanning the horizon, searching for answers that seemed to recede with each step.

They reached Kalm as dusk began to settle, the small town a welcome oasis of relative normalcy after the chaos of Midgar. The inn, a cozy, two-story building with warm light spilling from its windows, offered a temporary respite from their arduous journey. They gathered in a room on the second floor, the air thick with unspoken questions and a shared, gnawing anxiety.

"So let's hear your story......" Barret began, his voice a low rumble. "You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis facing the planet. Let's hear it all."

Cloud took a deep breath, the Mako-tinged air of Kalm doing little to soothe the turmoil within him. "I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER," he began, his voice flat, devoid of emotion. "After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends."

Barret snorted. "You call that a friend?"

"Yeah, well...... He's older than me, and he hardly ever talked about himself." Cloud’s gaze drifted towards Tifa, who sat listening intently, her expression unreadable. "So I guess you'd call him a war buddy...... We trusted each other. Until one day......"

Aeris leaned forward, her Mako-green eyes fixed on Cloud. "...one day?"

"After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra," Cloud continued, his voice a monotone recital of a past he barely understood. "......that was 5 years ago. I was 16......"

The world around them seemed to shimmer, the cozy confines of the Kalm inn dissolving into a memory, sharp and vivid. Cloud found himself in the back of a Shinra truck, the rain pounding against the canvas roof, the rhythmic clatter of the wheels a monotonous accompaniment to the oppressive silence. Sephiroth, his silver hair a stark contrast to the gloom, sat opposite him, his expression unreadable. Two Shinra infantrymen, their faces obscured by their helmets, sat hunched in the corners, their silence a testament to Sephiroth’s imposing presence.

"It sure is raining hard," Cloud heard his younger self say, his voice tinged with a youthful bravado that now seemed a distant, alien thing. He approached Sephiroth. "You going to brief us about this mission?"

Sephiroth’s gaze remained fixed on some distant, unseen point. "...this isn't a typical mission."

"Good!" young Cloud exclaimed. "I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you. But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over. My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war. That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself. Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?"

Sephiroth’s lips curved into a faint, almost imperceptible smile. "...I thought you wanted a briefing?" He paused, then continued, his voice cool and precise. "Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor. There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures. First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it."

"Brutal creatures... Where?"

"The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim."

"Nibelheim..." young Cloud breathed, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. "That's where I'm from."

Sephiroth’s gaze finally met his. "Hmm... hometown..."

A sudden, violent thud rocked the truck, throwing them against the sides. "Sir... s, something strange just crashed into our truck!" the driver yelled, his voice tight with panic.

Sephiroth rose, his movements fluid and graceful. "That would be our Monster..." He and Cloud stepped out into the torrential rain, a massive, green dragon, its scales glistening in the dim light, its eyes burning with a malevolent hunger, already coiling to strike. Sephiroth dispatched it with a contemptuous ease, his Masamune blade a blur of silver, leaving Cloud to stare in awe at the display of raw, untamed power.

"Sephiroth's strength is unreal," Cloud’s voice, back in the Kalm inn, was a hushed whisper. "He is far stronger in reality than any story you might have heard about him."

Aeris’s gaze was fixed on him, her expression a mixture of fascination and concern. "So... Where do you come in?"

Cloud looked away, a flicker of his old, detached self returning. "Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought." He paused, then continued, "......and then we reached Nibelheim."

The memory shifted, the rain-swept battlefield replaced by the familiar, if somewhat dilapidated, gates of Nibelheim. Sephiroth stood before them, his silver hair plastered to his forehead, his cloak billowing in the wind.

"How does it feel?" he asked, his voice surprisingly gentle. "It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right? So how does it feel? I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown..."

"Ummm... how 'bout your parents?" young Cloud ventured.

Sephiroth’s laughter was a harsh, brittle sound. "My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father..." He shook his head, a shadow crossing his features. "What does it matter...? All right, let's go."

Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and Aeris watched as the memory unfolded, a silent, ghostly audience to the events that had irrevocably shaped Cloud’s past. They saw Sephiroth, aloof and enigmatic, retreating to the inn, leaving Cloud and the two infantrymen to their own devices. They saw Cloud, a young, eager SOLDIER, exploring his hometown, his interactions with the villagers tinged with a strange, unsettling familiarity. He visited his mother, their conversations a blur of fragmented memories and unspoken emotions. He even, much to Tifa’s present-day embarrassment, ventured into her room, his clumsy attempts to play her piano a poignant reminder of a childhood that now seemed a distant, almost forgotten dream.

"Did you go into my room?" Tifa asked, her voice a soft whisper in the Kalm inn.

Cloud nodded, a faint flush coloring his cheeks. "Yeah...... I thought you might be home."

The memory shifted again, the quiet streets of Nibelheim replaced by the treacherous, snow-swept slopes of Mt. Nibel. Tifa, a surprisingly capable guide even then, led Cloud, Sephiroth, and the remaining infantryman towards the Mako reactor. They crossed a rickety rope bridge, the wind howling around them, the chasm below a terrifying abyss. The bridge snapped, sending them plummeting to the rocks below. Miraculously, they survived, though one of the infantrymen was lost.

They pressed on, their journey taking them through a series of eerily beautiful, Mako-infused caves. They came across a Mako fountain, its crystalline waters glowing with an unholy light. "Materia," Sephiroth explained, his voice tinged with a strange, almost reverent awe. "When you condense Mako energy, materia is produced. It's very rare to be able to see materia in its natural state." He spoke of the Ancients, of their ability to commune with the Planet, of the knowledge and wisdom held within the Materia. And he spoke of Hojo, the Shinra scientist, his voice laced with a contempt that bordered on hatred. "Hojo of Shinra, Inc. ... An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist. He was a walking mass of complexes."

Finally, they reached the Mako reactor, a monstrous, pulsating structure that seemed to thrum with an unnatural life. Tifa, her youthful curiosity overriding her fear, insisted on accompanying them inside. Sephiroth, with a dismissive wave of his hand, ordered the remaining infantryman to guard her.

Inside the reactor, the air was thick with the cloying stench of Mako, the sickly green luminescence bathing everything in an unnatural glow. They found a series of pods, each containing a grotesque, vaguely humanoid figure, its flesh twisted and mutated by Mako overexposure. "Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako," Sephiroth explained, his voice strangely detached. "You're different from the others, but still human. But, what are they? They've been exposed to a high degree of Mako, far more than you."

Cloud stared in horror. "Wh... what is this!?"

"Exactly," Sephiroth replied, his voice taking on a chilling intensity. "And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters. Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monster's really are." He paused, then added, his voice a low, dangerous whisper, "Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?" He clutched his head, a tormented expression on his face. "N... no...... Was I? ...Was I created this way too? Am I the same as all these monsters......" He began to slash at the pods, his Masamune blade a blur of silver, his laughter a wild, unhinged sound that echoed through the reactor. "You saw it! All of them... were humans..."

"Human!? No way!" Cloud exclaimed, recoiling from the madness in Sephiroth’s eyes.

"I've always felt since I was small... That I was different from the others. Special, in some way. But... not like this..." Sephiroth’s voice was a broken whisper, his earlier confidence shattered, replaced by a raw, agonizing uncertainty.

The memory faded, leaving Cloud and the others in the heavy silence of the Kalm inn. "Am I...... human?" Cloud’s voice was a hushed whisper, the question a stark, terrifying echo of Sephiroth’s own tormented cry. "I didn't quite understand what Sephiroth was saying at that time. I was even more surprised by the fact that Shinra was producing monsters."

Barret slammed his fist on the table. "Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!"

Tifa’s gaze was fixed on Cloud, her expression a mixture of pity and a dawning, unspoken fear. "......who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held a secret like that."

Red XIII nodded, his Mako-green eyes narrowed in thought. "That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently. I think we should listen carefully to Cloud. Don't you think so Barret?"

Cloud continued his story, his voice a monotone recital of a past that was becoming increasingly alien, even to himself. He told them of Sephiroth’s descent into madness, of his obsessive research in the Shinra mansion’s hidden library, of his discovery of Jenova, the "calamity from the skies," whom he believed to be his mother. He spoke of Sephiroth’s horrific revelation – that he was not a Cetra, but a product of the Jenova Project, an experiment in creating a being with the powers of the Ancients.

And then, he told them of the fire, of Sephiroth’s rampage through Nibelheim, of the slaughter of the villagers, of his own desperate, futile attempt to stop him. He described finding Tifa, grievously wounded, at the reactor, her father dead at Sephiroth’s hand. He spoke of his confrontation with Sephiroth in Jenova’s chamber, of Sephiroth’s chilling declaration of his intent to reclaim the Planet, of the final, desperate battle that had left Sephiroth… dead? Missing? Cloud couldn't be sure. His memory of that final, cataclysmic confrontation was a blur of pain and confusion, a gaping hole in the tattered fabric of his past.

"......and that's the end of my story," Cloud finished, his voice hoarse, his gaze distant.

Barret leaned forward, his eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Wait a damn minute! Ain't there more?"

Cloud shook his head. "......I don't remember."

Aeris’s voice was a soft whisper. "What happened to Sephiroth?"

"In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him," Cloud admitted, a familiar ache of inadequacy tightening his chest.

Tifa’s gaze was troubled. "Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper."

Aeris snorted. "Shinra, Inc. owns the paper, so you can't rely on that information."

Cloud’s fists clenched. "......I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened then. I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?"

Tifa’s voice was barely audible. "......I'm alive, too."

Aeris’s brow furrowed in thought. "Seems like a lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?"

"Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar," Cloud confirmed.

"Did someone else carry it out after that?" Aeris pressed. "It was missing from the Shinra building."

Tifa’s eyes widened in dawning horror. "Sephiroth......?"

Barret slammed his fist on the table, his patience exhausted. "Damn! Don't none of this make sense! I'm going, going, going, gone! And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you! Yo, Cloud! Let's get a move on!" He stood, his massive frame radiating a restless energy.

Cloud nodded, a grim determination settling over him. He still didn't have all the answers, but one thing was clear: Sephiroth was alive, and he was a threat that had to be stopped. The crisis facing the Planet was far greater, far more terrifying, than any of them had imagined. And Cloud, the ex-SOLDIER with a fragmented past and a Mako-infused future, was somehow, inextricably, at the heart of it all.

Outside the inn, the red-haired man who had earlier offered advice on navigating the world map approached them, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and excitement. "Listen to me! Just now, some guy in a black cloak goes walked east towards that grassy field. And he's got this killer sword, and is looking REAL scary......"

Sephiroth. Cloud exchanged a grim glance with his companions. Their path was clear. They had to follow him, to confront him, to unravel the mystery of his return, and to stop him before he could unleash whatever madness he was planning upon the unsuspecting Planet. The journey had taken a dark, ominous turn, but there was no turning back now. The fate of the world, it seemed, rested on their weary shoulders.

# Chapter 12: Chasing Phantoms

The grasslands east of Kalm stretched before them, a vast, windswept expanse under a perpetually bruised sky. The air was cool, carrying the faint, metallic tang of distant Mako. Cloud, Tifa, Barret, and Aeris pressed on, their earlier weariness momentarily forgotten in the face of this new, urgent pursuit. The man in the black cloak – Sephiroth, it had to be – was their only lead, a phantom figure luring them deeper into an uncertain future.

Their journey took them to a sprawling Chocobo farm, a haven of relative peace amidst the Mako-scarred landscape. The sight of the tall, flightless birds, their yellow feathers a vibrant splash of color against the muted tones of the grasslands, brought a fleeting moment of levity to their grim quest. Barret, surprisingly, seemed almost child-like in his fascination with the creatures, while Aeris, ever attuned to the rhythms of the natural world, found a quiet solace in their presence. Even Cloud, his usual stoicism firmly in place, felt a faint stirring of something akin to nostalgia, a distant echo of a simpler time.

They learned from the farm’s owner, Choco Bill, that the man in the black cloak had indeed passed through, heading towards the marshes to the east. "Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him," Bill had said, his voice grave. The Midgar Zolom, a monstrous serpent that roamed the marshes, was a creature of legend, its ferocity a stark warning to any who dared to venture into its domain.

Undeterred, they procured a Chocobo Lure Materia from Bill’s grandson, Choco Billy, a precocious youth with an encyclopedic knowledge of Chocobo lore. With the Lure equipped, they ventured out onto the grasslands, the tell-tale claw prints of wild Chocobos leading them on a merry chase. Capturing one of the elusive birds proved to be a surprisingly challenging, if somewhat comical, affair, but eventually, they managed to secure a mount, its powerful legs carrying them swiftly towards the treacherous marshes.

As they neared the marshlands, a chilling sight greeted them. The Midgar Zolom, its massive, serpentine body impaled on the skeletal branches of a dead tree, lay motionless, a testament to a power far greater, far more terrifying, than its own. "Did Sephiroth... do this......?" Cloud whispered, his voice a mixture of awe and a dawning, visceral fear. The sheer, destructive force required to slay such a creature was staggering. Sephiroth, it seemed, was even more powerful than Cloud remembered.

They pressed on, their earlier levity replaced by a grim determination. The marshes gave way to the dark, forbidding entrance of the Mythril Mines, a labyrinthine network of tunnels that burrowed deep into the earth. The air here was thick with the smell of damp earth and something else, something ancient and unsettling. As they navigated the treacherous passages, they stumbled upon a trio of familiar figures – Rude, Elena, and Tseng, of the Turks.

"Just a second!" Rude’s gruff voice echoed through the cavern, stopping them in their tracks.

Elena, her youthful exuberance a stark contrast to the grim surroundings, stepped forward, her hand on her hip. "I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short of people. ...Although, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks, ... In any case, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed. And to try and stop you every step of the way. Wait a minute, it's the other way around... You're the ones that are getting in our way."

Tseng, his face a mask of stoic professionalism, silenced her with a curt gesture. "...Elena. You talk too much. No need to tell them about our orders." He turned to Cloud, his gaze unwavering. "Well then, stay out of Shinra's way." With that, the Turks disappeared into the gloom, leaving Cloud and his companions to ponder the implications of their encounter. Shinra, it seemed, was also on Sephiroth’s trail. The game had just become a great deal more complicated.

Emerging from the oppressive darkness of the Mythril Mines, they found themselves in a sun-dappled forest, the air fresh and clean, a welcome respite from the Mako-tainted atmosphere of Midgar and the stale, subterranean air of the mines. But their reprieve was short-lived. A flash of movement in the undergrowth, a glint of steel, and they were ambushed by a "mystery ninja," a young woman with fiery red hair and an even fierier temper, who attacked them with a dizzying array of acrobatic maneuvers and a barrage of shuriken.

The battle was a chaotic, whirlwind affair, the ninja’s speed and agility a surprising match for Cloud’s Mako-enhanced strength. But eventually, they managed to subdue her, leaving her sprawled on the forest floor, her bravado momentarily extinguished.

"Man...... I can't believe I lost..." she grumbled, sitting up, her eyes blazing with a defiant anger. She leaped to her feet, her small frame radiating a surprising intensity. "You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!"

Cloud, weary from their relentless pursuit and the constant barrage of unexpected encounters, simply shook his head. "Not interested."

The ninja, Yuffie, as she eventually, and somewhat reluctantly, introduced herself, was not easily deterred. A self-proclaimed "Materia Hunter," she alternately cajoled, threatened, and wheedled her way into their party, her motives unclear, her presence an unwelcome, if somewhat amusing, complication. Cloud, sensing a kindred spirit in her restless energy and carefully guarded vulnerability, found himself, much to his surprise, agreeing to let her join them. Perhaps, he mused, there was strength in numbers, even if those numbers included a hot-headed, materia-obsessed ninja with a penchant for melodrama.

Their journey continued, the strange, eclectic group pressing on towards the coastal town of Junon, their pursuit of Sephiroth now a shared, if somewhat reluctant, endeavor. The shadow of the one-winged angel loomed large before them, a harbinger of a darkness that threatened to engulf not only their own fragile lives, but the very fate of the Planet itself. And Cloud, the ex-SOLDIER with a fragmented past and a Mako-infused future, knew, with a chilling certainty, that their paths were inextricably, and perhaps fatally, intertwined.

<div id="chapter-13"></div>

# Chapter 13: Journey to the West

Junon, a massive Shinra military installation and port city, loomed before them, a grim sentinel guarding the western seas. The lower town, a collection of dilapidated shanties and rusting fishing boats, huddled in the shadow of the colossal upper city, a stark testament to Shinra’s oppressive presence. The air was thick with the smell of salt, fish, and Mako, a cloying, unpleasant miasma that clung to their clothes and rasped in their throats.

They found the lower town all but deserted, its inhabitants either fled or cowed into silence by the overwhelming Shinra presence. An old fisherman, his face a roadmap of weathered lines and ancient sorrows, lamented the loss of the once-bountiful fishing grounds, his voice a mournful dirge against the rhythmic crash of the waves. "Ever since... Shinra built that city up above during the war," he rasped, his gaze fixed on the polluted waters, "There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted... phew..."

A young girl, Priscilla, her eyes bright with a fierce, youthful defiance, initially mistook them for Shinra operatives, her fear and anger a palpable force. But when a monstrous sea serpent attacked, threatening Priscilla and her beloved dolphin companion, Cloud and his companions sprang into action, their battle against the creature a desperate, hard-fought affair. Priscilla, caught in the ensuing chaos, was knocked unconscious, her small form tossed about by the churning waves.

Cloud, his heart pounding, waded into the treacherous waters, pulling Priscilla to safety. She wasn't breathing. "Young man, CPR, now!" an old man, Priscilla’s grandfather, urged, his voice tight with panic. Cloud hesitated, a strange reluctance washing over him. But the urgency of the situation, the sight of Priscilla’s still, pale face, overrode his reservations. He administered CPR, his breath mingling with hers, a desperate, life-giving exchange. After what seemed an eternity, Priscilla coughed, her eyes fluttering open, the spark of life returning to her fragile form.

Grateful for their assistance, Priscilla and her grandfather offered them shelter and a moment’s respite. While Priscilla rested, Cloud found himself plagued by unsettling visions, fragments of a past he couldn't quite grasp, his own identity a shifting, elusive thing. Tifa, sensing his turmoil, approached him, her gaze gentle but searching.

"When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim," Cloud began, his voice hesitant, "where were you?"

Tifa’s eyes clouded with a familiar uncertainty. "...We saw each other, right?"

"The other time," Cloud pressed, a desperate need for answers gnawing at him.

"No... it was 5 years ago. I don't remember." She paused, then added, her voice low, "But, something seems strange outside. Cloud, come quick."

They emerged from the small cottage to find the lower town abuzz with an uncharacteristic activity. The air thrummed with the sound of martial music, a discordant symphony of brass and drums echoing from the upper city. Rufus Shinra, the newly appointed President, was arriving, his presence casting a long, ominous shadow over the already beleaguered town.

"Seems like something's goin' on up there!" Barret exclaimed, his eyes narrowed in suspicion.

Priscilla, now recovered, explained, "I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra president."

"Rufus!?" Barret roared. "I gotta pay my respects."

Aeris’s brow furrowed in thought. "You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too? What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?"

Their only means of reaching the upper city, and the Shinra ships that might carry them across the sea in pursuit of Sephiroth, was a massive, high-voltage tower that connected the lower town to the upper plate. Priscilla, with the help of her dolphin companion, managed to propel Cloud to the top of the tower, a daring, acrobatic feat that left him breathless and exhilarated.

He found himself in the heart of the Shinra military base, a sprawling complex of hangars, barracks, and training grounds. The air was thick with the smell of Mako fuel and polished steel, the sounds of marching boots and barked commands a constant, oppressive rhythm. He was quickly apprehended by a harried Shinra commander, who, mistaking him for a tardy recruit, thrust a Shinra uniform into his hands and ordered him to prepare for Rufus’s welcoming parade.

Cloud, his mind still reeling from the fragmented memories and unsettling visions, found himself swept along by the tide of events. He donned the familiar, yet strangely alien, Shinra uniform, the crisp fabric a stark reminder of a past he was no longer sure was his own. He was drilled in the intricate, mind-numbingly precise formations of the welcoming parade, his movements, honed by years of SOLDIER training, surprisingly fluid and automatic.

The parade itself was a surreal, almost comical affair, a display of Shinra’s military might and a testament to their obsession with pomp and circumstance. Cloud, marching in lockstep with the other soldiers, his face a mask of stoic indifference, found himself an unwilling participant in the glorification of the very organization he now sought to destroy. Rufus, his expression one of cool, aristocratic disdain, observed the proceedings from a raised platform, his presence a chilling reminder of Shinra’s absolute, unyielding power.

After the parade, Cloud, still in his Shinra uniform, managed to slip away from his unit, his mind focused on one thing: reaching the docks and finding a ship that would take them across the sea. He explored the upper city, a sterile, soulless metropolis of gleaming steel and glass, its inhabitants a faceless, uniformed mass, their lives dictated by the whims of the Shinra corporation. He encountered Rude, of the Turks, in a smoky, dimly lit bar, the Turk’s usual stoic demeanor softened by an uncharacteristic melancholy. He learned of Hojo’s disappearance, of the growing unease within Shinra’s ranks, of the rumors of Sephiroth’s return.

Finally, he reached the docks, a bustling hub of activity, Shinra transport ships loading and unloading cargo, their massive engines thrumming with a restless energy. Red XIII, surprisingly, was already there, his fiery mane and Mako-green eyes a startling contrast to the drab, utilitarian surroundings. "Hey, hurry. You're the last one," he rumbled, his voice a low growl. "A dolphin gave me a ride. Priscilla remembered the dolphin after you climbed the pole. But, you mustn't be mad at her."

Cloud, his own journey to the upper city a testament to Priscilla’s resourcefulness, merely nodded. He spotted a large cargo ship, its deck already bustling with activity, its destination unknown, but its potential as a means of escape undeniable. He exchanged a quick, knowing glance with Red XIII, then, with a shared, unspoken understanding, they slipped aboard, melting into the shadows, their hopes, and their fears, set on the western horizon. The journey to the new continent, and the inevitable confrontation with Sephiroth, had begun.

<div id="chapter-14"></div>

# Chapter 14: The Weight of the Past

The rhythmic thrum of the cargo ship’s engines was a monotonous lullaby, the vast, empty expanse of the ocean a stark contrast to the claustrophobic confines of Midgar. Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aeris, Yuffie, and Red XIII, disguised in ill-fitting Shinra uniforms, found themselves unlikely stowaways, their shared pursuit of Sephiroth a fragile thread binding them together.

The ship was a hive of activity, Shinra sailors and soldiers bustling about their duties, their faces grim and preoccupied. The news of President Shinra’s death, and the subsequent ascent of his ruthless son, Rufus, had sent ripples of unease throughout the Shinra empire. And then there were the rumors, hushed whispers of Sephiroth’s return, of a darkness stirring in the north, a darkness that threatened to engulf them all.

Cloud, his own fragmented memories a constant, tormenting presence, found a strange solace in the anonymity of his Shinra disguise. He moved through the ship like a ghost, his Mako-infused eyes observing everything, his mind a whirl of conflicting emotions. He encountered Yuffie, her usual boisterous energy dampened by a bout of seasickness, her face a pale, miserable green. He found Aeris, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon, her thoughts, as always, a mystery. And he found Tifa, her usual warmth and resilience tinged with a quiet, unspoken sorrow.

"I really hate this uniform," Tifa confessed, her voice low, as they stood together on the windswept deck, the salt spray stinging their faces. "Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all. They take away all the things and people you love... I wish they'd all disappear. Right, Cloud?"

Cloud hesitated, the weight of his own past, of his own complicity in Shinra’s war machine, pressing down on him. "Yeah......" he finally managed, the word a hollow echo of Tifa’s own heartfelt plea.

Red XIII, his fiery mane a startling splash of color against the drab, utilitarian surroundings, maintained a stoic, watchful silence, his Mako-green eyes scanning the horizon, his keen senses alert to any hint of danger. Barret, however, was a maelstrom of restless energy, his grief and rage a palpable force. He paced the deck like a caged lion, his gun-arm twitching, his gaze fixed on the bridge, where Rufus and Heidegger, oblivious to their presence, plotted their next move.

"Look, Cloud. It's Rufus and Heidegger," Barret growled, his voice a low, dangerous rumble. "They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em... Ummmm...... Gmmmmm...... How can he...... Goin' off laughin' like that? Because of him, Biggs...... Wedge...... Jessie......! Ggggggggh... Ggggh......! Ggggggghhh!! God!! I can't take it anymore! I'm gonna settle things here and now......"

Suddenly, the ship’s emergency alert blared, its shrill, insistent cry cutting through the rhythmic thrum of the engines. _Emergency alert! Reports of a suspicious character found! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!_

Barret froze, his earlier rage momentarily forgotten. "Damn, did they find us!? Hey, that don't seem like us. Do they mean... Tifa and the others!?" He turned to Cloud, his eyes wide with a sudden, protective fear. "Get off your spikey butt and let's go, Cloud!"

They raced back to the cargo hold, where they found the others gathered, their faces pale with apprehension. "Everyone all right!?" Tifa exclaimed, her gaze sweeping over them.

"Hey, wait," Barret began, a dawning horror in his eyes. "You don't think that suspicious character is..."

A voice, cold and chillingly familiar, cut through the tense silence. "Sephiroth!?"

They whirled around, their weapons at the ready, their hearts pounding. But the cargo hold was empty, save for the shifting shadows and the distant, mournful cry of a seabird. "I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!" Barret roared, his frustration mounting. "Cloud, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?"

Cloud, his own mind a maelstrom of fragmented memories and unsettling premonitions, struggled to make sense of the situation. "...Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the planet... That was 5 years ago. Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra. And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth. He was carrying Jenova with him. ...This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova. ...I guess that's about it."

Before anyone could respond, the ship’s intercom crackled to life: _Dock workers--We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. Prepare for docking._

"Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere," Barret urged, his earlier bravado replaced by a pragmatic urgency. They scattered, seeking refuge in the labyrinthine depths of the cargo hold, their minds reeling from the implications of Cloud’s fragmented, terrifying tale.

As they sought to conceal themselves, a chilling premonition washed over Cloud. The engine room… He felt an irresistible pull, a sense of dread and a morbid curiosity drawing him towards the ship’s metallic heart. He found the engine room deserted, save for two Shinra sailors and a soldier, their lifeless bodies sprawled on the grimy floor. "Is it...... Sephiroth?" Cloud whispered, his voice a choked gasp.

The remaining soldier, his eyes wide with terror, his body trembling, turned to face him. "...the Engine Room... ...a suspicious...... character... No...... there's no way...... that...... not a human...... That thing's not human......" He collapsed, his last, terrified words a chilling testament to the horror he had witnessed.

"No... not Sephiroth!" Cloud exclaimed, his gaze sweeping the room. And then he saw him. Sephiroth. Or rather, an apparition of Sephiroth, his silver hair flowing, his Mako-green eyes burning with an unholy light, rising through the floor of the engine room like a phantom, his lips curved in a silent, mocking smile.

"Sephiroth! You're alive!" Cloud cried, his voice a mixture of disbelief and a dawning, visceral fear.

Sephiroth’s gaze, cold and indifferent, swept over him. "......Who are you?"

"You don't remember me!? I'm Cloud!"

"Cloud..." Sephiroth murmured, his voice a sibilant whisper.

"Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?"

"...the time...... is now..." Sephiroth hissed, his form beginning to shimmer and distort.

"What!? What are you saying!? Be more......"

Sephiroth laughed, a cold, chilling sound, and then, with a final, contemptuous glance, he flew upwards, phasing through the ceiling, leaving Cloud and his companions to face the grotesque, pulsating monstrosity that was Jenova∙BIRTH.

The battle was a desperate, nightmarish affair, the creature’s amorphous form shifting and contorting, its attacks a relentless barrage of psychic and physical assaults. But Cloud and his companions, fueled by a mixture of terror and a grim determination, fought with a savage intensity, their combined strength slowly, agonizingly, overwhelming the abomination. Finally, with a final, gurgling shriek, Jenova∙BIRTH dissolved, leaving behind only a small, pulsating tentacle, a grotesque reminder of its unholy presence.

"...Jenova," Cloud whispered, his voice hoarse. "The arm of Jenova."

"Jenova...You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?" Barret exclaimed, his face a mask of disgust and disbelief.

"So it WAS Sephiroth," Cloud confirmed, a chilling certainty settling over him. "He said the time is now."

"The time is now...?" Tifa echoed, her voice trembling. "What does that mean?"

Cloud shook his head, the weight of the unknown, of the terrifying implications of Sephiroth’s return and his cryptic pronouncements, pressing down on him. The cargo ship, its engines still thrumming, continued its relentless journey towards Costa del Sol, towards a future that was becoming increasingly, terrifyingly, uncertain. The phantom of Sephiroth, and the grotesque reality of Jenova, had cast a long, dark shadow over their already perilous quest.

<div id="chapter-15"></div>

# Chapter 15: The Gold Saucer's Shadow

Costa del Sol, a sun-drenched resort town nestled on the western continent, was a jarring contrast to the oppressive gloom of Midgar and the grim, utilitarian confines of the Shinra cargo ship. Palm trees swayed in the gentle sea breeze, the turquoise waters of the ocean sparkled invitingly, and the air was filled with the carefree laughter of tourists and the tantalizing aroma of exotic foods. But for Cloud and his companions, the idyllic setting was merely a temporary reprieve, a fleeting illusion of peace in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.

"Damn! Sure is hot here!" Barret exclaimed, stripping off his uncomfortable sailor suit with a sigh of relief. "But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit. Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!"

Aeris giggled. "Oh, too bad. I liked Barret's sailor suit. He looked so cute."

Barret scowled. "......What'ya mean "cute"?"

Tifa, ever the diplomat, chimed in, "Right... well, uh... Barret, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas? Right, Cloud?"

Cloud, still reeling from their encounter with Sephiroth and Jenova, managed a noncommittal, "I guess." He couldn't shake the image of Sephiroth, of his cold, indifferent gaze, of his chilling pronouncement: "...the time...... is now..."

"Remember, this isn't a vacation," Cloud reminded them, his voice grim. "We're here after Sephiroth. I'm going on ahead."

Barret grumbled, "Hmmph, Cloud. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time. I'm going to skip this resort!" He stormed off, his usual bluster somewhat subdued.

Aeris, Tifa, and Yuffie, however, were eager to explore, their youthful spirits momentarily unburdened by the weight of their mission. "Maybe I should get a tan for a change," Aeris mused, her eyes sparkling. "Which do you like, Cloud?"

Cloud, caught off guard, muttered, "I like fair complexions."

Aeris beamed. "Got it. I'll remember that." She and Tifa, their earlier anxieties forgotten, ran off towards the beach, their laughter echoing in the warm, tropical air. Yuffie, with a mischievous grin, declared, "Don't bother looking for me!" and disappeared into the bustling marketplace. Red XIII, his fiery mane unsuited to the tropical heat, sought refuge in the shade, his Mako-green eyes watchful and alert.

Cloud, left alone, found himself drawn to the beach, the rhythmic crash of the waves a soothing counterpoint to the turmoil in his own mind. He found Hojo, of all people, lounging on a beach chair, surrounded by a bevy of bikini-clad admirers, his presence a jarring, unwelcome intrusion into the idyllic setting.

"Long time no see, Cloud," Hojo greeted him, his voice oozing a familiar, reptilian charm.

Cloud’s eyes narrowed. "Hojo...... What are you doing?"

"It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan." Hojo smirked. "I believe we're both after the same goal."

"You mean Sephiroth?"

Hojo’s smirk widened. "Did you see him? I see...... Ha! Ha!" He paused, then continued, his voice taking on a chilling intensity. "Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you? Or that you had to visit some place?......"

Cloud’s hand instinctively went to the hilt of the Buster Sword. "I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at! To beat him and put an end to all this!"

Hojo chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "I see...... This could be interesting. Were you in SOLDIER? .......Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?" He then turned his attention to Aeris, who had rejoined Cloud, her earlier carefree demeanor replaced by a quiet, watchful intensity. "Say, aren't you the 'Ancient'?"

Aeris met Hojo’s gaze, her own Mako-green eyes unwavering. "I'm Aeris. The least you can do is remember my name. I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo... I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me."

Hojo’s eyes glittered with a disturbing, scientific curiosity. "Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?"

"You didn't know!? She died."

"......I see."

"Professor Hojo..." Aeris pressed, her voice urgent. "Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?"

Hojo merely mumbled, his gaze distant, "...mumble... mumble... head west......"

"He's mumbling slowly..." Aeris observed, her frustration mounting. "That must mean he's hiding something!" But Hojo remained uncooperative, his secrets, like Sephiroth’s motives, shrouded in a frustrating, impenetrable mystery.

Their search for Sephiroth led them westward, through the rugged, sun-baked terrain of the Corel Mountains. The journey was arduous, the landscape a stark reminder of the Planet’s raw, untamed power. They came across an old man, his face weathered by years of solitary existence, who confirmed that a man in a black cloak had indeed passed through, heading towards the abandoned Mako reactor that scarred the mountainside.

The reactor, a rusting, dilapidated monument to Shinra’s greed, stood silent and desolate, its once-thrumming heart now stilled. But as they approached, they found it was not entirely abandoned. A small, impoverished settlement, North Corel, clung to the mountainside, its inhabitants a grim, resilient people, their lives irrevocably scarred by Shinra’s exploitation.

It was here that Barret’s carefully constructed facade of bluster and bravado finally crumbled, revealing the raw, aching grief that lay beneath. This was his hometown, or what was left of it, a place of bitter memories and unfulfilled dreams. He told them of Dyne, his childhood friend, of their shared hopes for a better future, of Shinra’s arrival, and the Mako reactor that had promised prosperity but delivered only destruction. He spoke of the explosion, of the fire that had consumed Corel, of the loss of his wife, Myrna, of the gun-arm that was now a constant, painful reminder of his own complicity in Shinra’s rapacious greed.

His story was a heartbreaking testament to the human cost of Shinra’s relentless pursuit of Mako, a grim echo of the devastation they had witnessed in Sector 7. Cloud, Tifa, and Aeris listened in silence, their own hearts heavy with a shared sense of loss and a growing, righteous anger.

From North Corel, a rickety ropeway led to the Gold Saucer, a massive, garish amusement park that floated in the sky like a monstrous, gilded mirage. It was a place of dazzling lights, mind-numbing noise, and a desperate, frenetic energy, a stark contrast to the grim realities of the world below. Here, amidst the cacophony of arcade games, chocobo races, and theatrical extravaganzas, they encountered Cait Sith, a robotic, fortune-telling cat perched atop a giant, stuffed moogle.

"Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?" Cait Sith exclaimed, his voice a bizarre, synthesized purr. "How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A happy future! Oh, but don't hold it against me if it's not a great prediction! Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's... Cait Sith."

Cait Sith, with his uncanny ability to "find missing things, missing people, anything," quickly latched onto their quest, his motives, like Yuffie’s, shrouded in a playful, enigmatic ambiguity. He read Cloud’s fortune – "What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear" – a cryptic pronouncement that sent a shiver of unease down Cloud’s spine. And then, with a cheerful, "I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!", he joined their already eclectic, and increasingly bizarre, party.

Their time at the Gold Saucer, however, was cut short by a grim discovery. In the Battle Square, a popular attraction where patrons could test their combat skills against a variety of monstrous opponents, they found a scene of carnage – Shinra soldiers, their bodies riddled with bullets, their faces frozen in expressions of terror. And the culprit, according to a terrified, wounded staff member, was "a man with a gun... on his arm......"

Barret. The implication was horrifying, unthinkable. But before they could confront him, they were apprehended by Dio, the flamboyant, muscle-bound owner of the Gold Saucer, who, mistaking them for the perpetrators, unceremoniously dumped them into Corel Prison, a desolate, inescapable wasteland that lay in the shadow of the glittering amusement park. The Gold Saucer, it seemed, had a dark, hidden underbelly, a place where broken dreams and shattered lives were left to fester and die. And Cloud, his own identity still a fragile, fractured thing, found himself once again a prisoner, his pursuit of Sephiroth, and the truth, seemingly at a dead end.

<div id="chapter-16"></div>

# Chapter 16: Dyne's Despair

Corel Prison was a desolate, sun-baked wasteland, a garbage dump for the Gold Saucer's unwanted souls. Surrounded by an endless expanse of quicksand, it was a place from which, it was said, no one ever escaped. Cloud, Cait Sith, and their chosen companion found themselves thrust into this grim, hopeless world, their earlier, fleeting amusement at the Gold Saucer's attractions a distant, mocking memory.

And then they saw him. Barret. Standing alone amidst the debris, his massive frame radiating a chilling, almost palpable despair. A lifeless body lay at his feet, a fresh bullet hole in its chest. "Stay back!" Barret snarled, his voice a low, dangerous growl. "This's something I gotta deal with. Jes' leave me alone..." He turned and fled, disappearing into the labyrinthine shantytown that comprised the prison.

Cloud’s heart sank. The evidence was damning. The man with the gun-arm… Could Barret, his grief and rage finally consuming him, have been responsible for the carnage at the Battle Square? The thought was a chilling, unwelcome intrusion.

They followed Barret, their inquiries about him met with a mixture of fear, suspicion, and a strange, almost reverent awe. The prisoners, a motley collection of outcasts and broken men, spoke of a "Boss," a man with a gun-arm who ruled the prison with an iron fist. And they spoke of Dyne, Barret’s childhood friend, the man who had shared his dreams, and his despair.

Barret’s story, when he finally, reluctantly, shared it, was a heartbreaking tale of betrayal, loss, and a grief that had festered into a corrosive, all-consuming rage. He told them of Dyne, of their shared past in Corel, of the arrival of Shinra and the Mako reactor that had promised prosperity but delivered only destruction. He spoke of the fire, of the loss of his wife, Myrna, of the searing pain of his own injuries, and of Dyne’s descent into madness, his grief twisting into a desperate, nihilistic desire to destroy everything, including himself.

"There's another... another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms," Barret confessed, his voice thick with a weary resignation. "It was four years ago..." He recounted the horrific events, the Shinra attack, the burning of Corel, Dyne’s desperate, futile attempt to save him, the searing pain as their joined hands were shattered by Shinra bullets, Dyne’s plummet into the ravine below. "From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more," Barret continued, his voice a low, agonized whisper. "...I was depressed for a while. But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in. Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away... Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me. But, his was the left arm."

The truth, when it finally emerged, was both a relief and a fresh wave of despair. The "Boss" of Corel Prison, the man with the gun-arm, was Dyne, his body and spirit irrevocably scarred by Shinra’s cruelty, his grief a mirror image of Barret’s own.

The confrontation between the two friends, once brothers in arms, now bitter, grief-stricken adversaries, was a tragic, inevitable clash. They met in a desolate junkyard, amidst the rusted, skeletal remains of a forgotten world, the ghosts of their shared past a silent, mournful audience.

"Dyne... Is that you?" Barret whispered, his voice choked with a mixture of hope and a dawning, visceral fear.

Dyne, his face a mask of pain and madness, his left arm a grotesque parody of Barret’s own, turned to face him. "Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years... A voice I'll never forget..."

Barret’s plea for forgiveness, for understanding, for a shared path towards redemption, fell on deaf ears. Dyne, consumed by his grief, his sanity shattered, saw only one way out: destruction. "I got nothing left in this world," he rasped, his voice a hollow echo of the man he once was. "Corel, Eleanor...... Marlene......"

"Dyne, Marlene...... Marlene's still alive," Barret revealed, his voice trembling. "I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure. That is why I wanted to be by her side till the end. That's when I found her... ...found Marlene. She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?"

But Dyne, his mind too far gone, his grief too deeply ingrained, could not be swayed. "Eleanor's alone all by herself," he declared, his eyes burning with a mad, feverish light. "I've got to take Marlene to her." He raised his gun-arm, his intent clear. "All right, Barret. I guess that means you and I gotta fight."

The battle was a heartbreaking, fratricidal duel, a tragic culmination of years of shared pain and unspoken resentments. Barret, his own heart heavy with a grief that mirrored Dyne’s own, fought with a reluctant, desperate courage, his attacks a desperate plea for his friend to see reason, to choose life over the abyss of despair that threatened to consume him.

But Dyne, his spirit broken, his will to live extinguished, could not be saved. Defeated, he slumped to the ground, his gaze distant, his voice a broken whisper. "It wasn't just my arm...... back then...... I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where I went wrong..." He pressed a small, tarnished pendant into Barret’s hand. "Give that pendant to Marlene... It was... Eleanor's... my wife's... memento..." With a final, sorrowful glance at Barret, he stumbled towards the edge of the ravine. "Barret... Don't...... make... ......Don't ever make Marlene...... cry..." And then, with a sigh that seemed to carry the weight of all his lost hopes and shattered dreams, he let himself fall, disappearing into the abyss below.

Barret’s anguished cry, "Dy------ne!!", echoed through the desolate wasteland, a raw, primal scream of grief and despair. He fell to his knees, the pendant clutched in his hand, the weight of his own survival, of Dyne’s tragic end, a crushing burden. "...Dyne. Me an' you were the same... My hands ain't any cleaner...... I shouldn't be able to carry... Marlene either... Uuuurrrrrrgh!!!"

Their escape from Corel Prison was a somber, muted affair. Mr. Coates, Dyne’s second-in-command, shaken by his leader’s demise, agreed to help them, arranging for Cloud to participate in the Gold Saucer’s Chocobo races, the only means of earning their freedom. Ester, a surprisingly capable and compassionate young woman who served as a Chocobo race manager, took Cloud under her wing, her quiet strength a welcome contrast to the prison’s oppressive atmosphere.

Cloud, his own mind still a maelstrom of fragmented memories and unsettling premonitions, found a strange solace in the focused intensity of the Chocobo races. He rode with a reckless abandon, his Mako-enhanced reflexes and a lifetime of suppressed aggression finding an outlet in the thundering hooves and fierce competition. He won, his victory securing not only his own freedom, but that of his companions.

Dio, the flamboyant owner of the Gold Saucer, impressed by Cloud’s skill and perhaps a little chastened by the events that had transpired in his "garbage dump," granted them a full pardon and, as a gesture of goodwill, a dune buggy, a rugged, all-terrain vehicle that would allow them to traverse the treacherous desert landscape that lay beyond Corel.

Their journey, it seemed, was far from over. Sephiroth was still out there, his motives a terrifying enigma, his power a looming threat. And Cloud, his own identity still a fragile, fractured thing, knew, with a chilling certainty, that their paths were destined to cross again. The weight of the past, of Nibelheim, of Corel, of Aeris’s capture, of Dyne’s tragic end, pressed down on him, a heavy, suffocating burden. But amidst the despair, a flicker of hope remained. They were free. They were together. And they would not rest until Sephiroth was stopped, and the Planet, their wounded, dying Planet, was safe.

<div id="chapter-17"></div>

# Chapter 17: Whispers of the Ancients

The dune buggy, a surprisingly resilient vehicle, carried them south, across the sun-baked plains and through the skeletal remains of a petrified forest, towards the village of Gongaga. The landscape was stark and unforgiving, a testament to the Planet’s ancient, untamed power. The air was thick with the scent of dust and decay, the silence broken only by the rhythmic roar of the buggy’s engine and the distant, mournful cry of an unseen bird.

Gongaga, when they finally reached it, was a small, unassuming village nestled in a lush, tropical jungle, a stark contrast to the desolate wasteland they had just traversed. But the idyllic setting was deceptive. A ruined Mako reactor, its skeletal frame a grim reminder of Shinra’s rapacious greed, scarred the landscape, its presence a constant, oppressive weight on the spirits of the villagers.

Here, amidst the verdant jungle and the crumbling ruins of a forgotten past, they encountered the Turks once more. Reno and Rude, their usual arrogant swagger somewhat subdued, were clearly on a mission, their presence a disquieting reminder that Shinra’s tendrils reached even into these remote, forgotten corners of the world. "Payback time for what you did in Sector 7," Reno sneered, his voice laced with a familiar, reptilian menace. The ensuing battle was a fierce, desperate affair, the Turks, despite their nonchalant demeanor, proving to be formidable adversaries. But Cloud and his companions, their own skills honed by their relentless pursuit of Sephiroth, managed to defeat them, sending them scurrying back into the jungle, their mission, for now, unfulfilled.

Their encounter with the Turks left Cloud with a gnawing unease. How had they known to find them here? "They followed us......" he mused, his Mako-infused eyes scanning the dense jungle foliage. "But there weren't any signs of it. Then, that means......"

"A spy, maybe?" Barret growled, his gaze sweeping over their small, eclectic group. "No, no way."

"A spy!?...No way," Tifa echoed, though a flicker of doubt shadowed her eyes.

Cloud shook his head, unwilling to voice the suspicion that was beginning to take root in his own mind. "I don't even want to think that there's a spy... I trust everyone." But the seed of doubt had been planted, a tiny, insidious worm that gnawed at the fragile bonds of their unlikely alliance.

Their exploration of Gongaga led them to the ruined Mako reactor, where they stumbled upon a clandestine meeting between Scarlet, Shinra’s ruthless Head of Weapon Development, and Tseng, the stoic leader of the Turks. "This reactor's a failure," Scarlet declared, her voice dripping with contempt. "You only get junky materia from junky reactors. What I'm looking for is big, large, huge materia. You seen any?"

Tseng, his face a mask of impassive professionalism, replied, "...No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away."

Scarlet’s eyes glittered with a disturbing, avaricious light. "Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some."

Huge Materia… The ultimate weapon… Cloud’s mind reeled. Shinra’s ambition, it seemed, knew no bounds. Their relentless pursuit of power, their willingness to sacrifice anything, anyone, in the name of progress, was a terrifying, insatiable hunger that threatened to consume the very Planet itself.

In the heart of Gongaga village, amidst the simple, thatched-roof huts and the quiet, resilient people, they found a small, unassuming house, the home of an elderly couple whose son, Zack, had left years ago, his dreams set on joining SOLDIER. "His name is Zack," the old man said, his voice tinged with a father’s quiet pride. "It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying that he didn't want to live in the country... He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?"

Aeris gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. "Zack..."

The old woman’s eyes lit up. "I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?"

Aeris shook her head, a faint blush coloring her cheeks. "That can't..." She turned and fled the house, her usual composure momentarily shattered.

Tifa, too, seemed strangely affected by the mention of Zack’s name, her gaze distant, her expression unreadable. "Zack..." she murmured, before following Aeris outside.

Cloud, his own memories of Zack a confusing, fragmented jumble, found himself increasingly bewildered. Zack… Aeris’s first love… A SOLDIER First Class, just like Cloud believed himself to be… Yet, Cloud had no clear recollection of him. The pieces didn't fit. The puzzle of his own past, of his own identity, was becoming increasingly, terrifyingly, complex.

"What a shock..." Aeris confessed, her voice trembling slightly as Cloud joined her outside. "I didn't know Zack was from this town."

"You know him?" Cloud asked, though he already suspected the answer.

"Didn't I tell you?" Aeris replied, a wistful smile on her lips. "He was my first love." She paused, then continued, her voice tinged with a quiet sorrow. "Zack... SOLDIER First Class. Same as Cloud."

Cloud’s frown deepened. "Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've never heard of him."

"That's all right," Aeris said, her gaze distant. "It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing."

"Missing?"

"I think it was 5 years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back. He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else..." She looked at Cloud, her Mako-green eyes searching his. "Hey? What's wrong?"

Cloud, unnerved by the intensity of her gaze, and by the strange, unsettling echoes of his own fragmented past, could only manage a noncommittal, "Poor guy."

Tifa, when Cloud questioned her, was equally evasive. "Zack...... N, no, I don't know him!" she insisted, though her flushed cheeks and averted gaze told a different story. "That sounds just like you," she added, her voice a little too bright, "leaving town, and saying 'I'm joining SOLDIER!'."

Cloud, his mind a maelstrom of conflicting emotions and unanswered questions, felt a growing sense of unease. Zack… Aeris… Tifa… Their shared past, their hidden secrets, their strange, unsettling connection to his own fragmented memories… It was a tangled web of lies and half-truths, a labyrinth of deception that threatened to consume him.

They left Gongaga, the whispers of the Ancients, of Zack, of a past he couldn't quite remember, echoing in Cloud’s mind. Their journey had taken a dark, introspective turn, their pursuit of Sephiroth now inextricably linked to their own personal quests for truth, for identity, for a redemption that seemed to recede with each passing day. The weight of the past, and the terrifying uncertainty of the future, pressed down on them, a heavy, suffocating burden. But they pressed on, their resolve fueled by a desperate hope, and by the fragile, unspoken bonds that held them together.

<div id="chapter-18"></div>

# Chapter 18: Cosmo Canyon's Truths

The buggy rumbled on, carrying them north from Gongaga, through a landscape that grew increasingly stark and desolate. The verdant jungle gave way to arid plains, the air thick with the taste of dust and the distant, metallic tang of Mako. Ahead, a towering, crimson-hued canyon rose from the earth, its jagged peaks silhouetted against the perpetually bruised sky. Cosmo Canyon. Red XIII’s – Nanaki’s – home.

As they approached the canyon’s entrance, Nanaki, his usual stoic demeanor replaced by a restless, almost child-like excitement, bounded ahead. "I am home! It is I, Nanaki!" he announced, his voice echoing through the silent, windswept canyon.

A wizened figure, his skin the color of weathered leather, his eyes bright with an ancient wisdom, emerged from a crevice in the canyon wall. "Hey, Nanaki! You're safe! Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!"

Nanaki darted up a narrow, winding staircase carved into the canyon wall, disappearing into the labyrinthine depths of his ancestral home. Cloud and the others followed, their earlier weariness momentarily forgotten in the face of this strange, awe-inspiring place.

Cosmo Canyon was a place of profound, almost spiritual beauty. The air was clear and crisp, the silence broken only by the whisper of the wind as it snaked through the narrow gorges and towering rock formations. It was a place of study, a sanctuary for those who sought to understand the delicate balance between the Planet and its inhabitants, a place where the ancient wisdom of the Cetra still lingered, a faint, ethereal echo in the silent, windswept canyons.

"Here is where I was... I mean, ...this is my hometown," Nanaki explained, his voice tinged with a mixture of pride and a deep, abiding sorrow. "My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet. My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her...... I am the last of my race."

"Cowardly father?" Cloud questioned, his brow furrowed.

Nanaki’s Mako-green eyes flashed with a sudden, bitter anger. "Yes. My father was a wastrel. And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors, is to protect this place. My journey ends here."

A booming, jovial voice interrupted them. "Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!" An elderly man, his face a roadmap of wrinkles, his eyes twinkling with a mischievous light, emerged from a doorway high above them. Bugenhagen. Nanaki’s grandfather.

"Coming, Grandpa!" Nanaki yelped, his earlier solemnity replaced by a surprising, almost boyish exuberance. He bounded up the stairs, leaving Cloud and the others to explore the labyrinthine wonders of Cosmo Canyon.

They found Barret, his usual bluster subdued, gazing in awe at the towering rock formations. "Cosmo Canyon..." he murmured, his voice hushed. "This's where AVALANCHE was born... I always wanted to come here... And... I finally...... made it."

Aeris, her senses attuned to the subtle energies of the Planet, seemed to draw strength from the canyon’s ancient, mystical atmosphere. "Maybe there are some people here that know about the Promised Land and the Ancients," she mused, her Mako-green eyes alight with a quiet, hopeful anticipation.

Tifa, too, seemed captivated by the canyon’s stark, ethereal beauty. "Nanaki...... I wonder what's happened to Nanaki...? He's as excited as a little boy."

Cloud, however, found himself increasingly drawn to the observatory at the canyon’s summit, a place where, it was said, one could hear the very cries of the Planet. He ascended the winding staircase, his heart pounding with a strange mixture of trepidation and a dawning, inexplicable hope.

He found Nanaki and Bugenhagen in the observatory, a vast, circular chamber filled with strange, whirring contraptions and intricate, celestial charts. "Cloud, this is my grandfather, Bugen," Nanaki announced, his voice tinged with a proud, almost reverent affection. "He is incredible. He knows everything."

Bugenhagen chuckled, a dry, rasping sound. "Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki a bit. Nanaki is still a child you see."

Nanaki bristled. "Please stop, grandfather. I'm 48."

"Ho Ho Hoooo," Bugenhagen chortled. "Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity. So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning."

Cloud’s eyes widened. "15 or 16!?"

Bugenhagen’s gaze softened as he looked at Nanaki. "He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?"

Nanaki’s Mako-green eyes burned with a fierce, youthful determination. "......grandfather. I want to be an adult. I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village."

Bugenhagen shook his head, a sad smile on his lips. "Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet. To do that now would destroy you in the long run. Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you? Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective. When it's time for this planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing."

"...When the planet dies?" Cloud asked, a chill settling in his heart.

"Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now... But it's not long off."

"How do you know this?"

Bugenhagen’s gaze grew distant, his eyes fixed on some unseen, sorrowful horizon. "I hear the cries of the Planet." A low, throbbing hum filled the observatory, a sound that seemed to resonate deep within Cloud’s own Mako-infused being. "The sounds of the stars in the heavens," Bugenhagen explained. "While this goes on, planets are born, and die." A high-pitched, keening wail joined the throbbing hum, a sound of pure, unadulterated anguish. "Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from this planet. Didn't you hear it? As if to say... I hurt, I suffer......"

Nanaki stepped forward, his voice urgent. "They have come here on a journey to save the planet. Why don't you show them your apparatus?"

Bugenhagen chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. "Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo! But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him." He led Cloud and his chosen companions to a strange, intricate machine in the center of the observatory, a complex array of gears, lenses, and glowing crystals. "Here, over here," he instructed. "The door's unlocked, come on in."

Cloud stepped onto a circular platform, which, with a whir of gears and a flash of Mako-green light, ascended into the heart of the machine. He found himself in a holographic representation of the solar system, the planets and stars swirling around him in a breathtaking, three-dimensional display.

"Hmm, yes pretty good," Bugenhagen commented, his voice echoing through the chamber. "This is my laboratory. All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic System." He gestured towards the swirling celestial bodies. "Eventually... all humans die. What happens to them after they die? The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls? The soul too returns to the Planet. And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same. The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet. They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'. Lifestream... In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet. 'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget. A new life... children are blessed with Spirit energy and are brought into the world. Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet... Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world."

The holographic display shifted, showing a stylized representation of a human life cycle – birth, death, the return of spirit energy to the Lifestream, the subsequent nourishment of new life. "Spirit energy makes all things possible," Bugenhagen continued, his voice grave. "trees, birds, and humans. Not just living things. But Spirit energy makes it possible for Planets to be Planets. What happens if that Spirit energy were to disappear?" The Lifestream in the holographic display dwindled, the Planet model crumbling into dust. "......These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life."

Cloud’s mind reeled. "If the Spirit energy is lost, our Planet is destroyed..."

Bugenhagen nodded. "Spirit energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within nature. When Spirit energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it can't accomplish its true purpose."

"You're talking about Mako energy, right?" Cloud asked, a dawning understanding in his eyes.

"Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit energy, diminishing it," Bugenhagen confirmed. "Spirit energy gets compressed in the reactors and processed into Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away. In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet..."

The holographic display faded, leaving them in the dim, Mako-infused light of the observatory. The weight of Bugenhagen’s words, of the terrifying implications of Shinra’s relentless Mako extraction, pressed down on Cloud, a heavy, suffocating burden. The cries of the Planet, its anguished screams, now seemed to echo not only in the observatory, but in the deepest, most hidden corners of his own troubled soul. The fight to save the Planet, he realized, was not just a fight against Sephiroth, or against Shinra. It was a fight against a far more insidious, far more terrifying enemy – the slow, inexorable death of the Planet itself.

<div id="chapter-19"></div>

# Chapter 19: A Father's Legacy

The flickering light of the Cosmo Candle cast long, dancing shadows across the gathered faces. Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aeris, and Nanaki sat in a somber circle, the weight of Bugenhagen’s revelations settling heavily upon them. The Planet was dying, its life force slowly, inexorably being drained by Shinra’s insatiable Mako reactors. And Sephiroth, with his mad quest for the Promised Land and his terrifying, god-like power, was merely a symptom of a far deeper, far more insidious malaise.

"Cosmo Canyon... This's where AVALANCHE was born..." Barret mused, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. "I promised my guys someday... when we saved the planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate... Biggs... Wedge... Jessie... Now they're all gone... died for the planet." His gaze drifted towards the flickering flames, a raw, aching grief in his eyes. "Really? To save the planet? We all... we all hate the Shinra... Do I even got a right to go on? Will they......... will they ever forgive me? ...Right now, I really don't know. But I know one thing. If there's anything I can do, to save the planet... or the people livin' on it... Then I'm gonna do it! I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care...... let 'em decide for 'emselves." He rose, his massive frame radiating a renewed, if somewhat desperate, determination. "Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!! Again... Again... AVALANCHE's born again!"

Aeris, her Mako-green eyes fixed on the flames, spoke softly, her voice tinged with a quiet sorrow. "I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things. About the Cetra... And the Promised Land... I'm...... alone... I'm all alone now..."

Cloud’s gaze met hers, a flicker of something unreadable in his Mako-infused eyes. "But I'm...... we're here for you, right?"

Aeris managed a faint smile. "I know. I know, but... I am the only...... Cetra."

"Does that mean we can't help?" Cloud pressed, a strange, unsettling premonition washing over him.

Aeris’s gaze drifted away, her expression unreadable. "......"

Tifa, her usual warmth and resilience somewhat subdued, sighed. "Cloud... Bonfires are funny, aren't they? They make you remember all sorts of things. You know, Cloud. 5 Years ago... ......It's nothing. No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask..."

"What is it...?" Cloud prompted, sensing her unease.

Tifa’s voice was barely a whisper. "It feels like... it feels like you're going far away... You really, really are...... you... right?" The unspoken question, the fear that had haunted her since Cloud’s reappearance in Sector 7, hung heavy in the air.

Nanaki, who had been listening intently, his fiery mane a stark contrast to the somber mood, finally spoke, his voice low and hesitant. "...Long ago. ...When I was still very small. We were all around this flame... No, never mind..."

"What happened?" Cloud asked, sensing the deep, unspoken pain in Nanaki’s voice.

"It's about my parents," Nanaki confessed, his Mako-green eyes clouded with a familiar, bitter anger. "When I talk about my mother, I am full of pride and joy... And that's fine. ...But when I remember my father, my heart is full of anger..."

Bugenhagen, who had joined them at the Cosmo Candle, his ancient eyes twinkling in the firelight, interjected, his voice gentle but firm. "...You really can't forgive your father...?"

Nanaki’s gaze hardened. "Of course. He...... left mother for dead. When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving mother and the people of the Canyon!"

Bugenhagen sighed, a sound like the rustling of dry leaves. "...Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see." He rose, his movements surprisingly agile for his advanced age, and beckoned them to follow. "The place may be dangerous. Cloud. Will you and one other person come with us?"

Cloud nodded, selecting Barret to accompany them. They followed Bugenhagen and Nanaki through a narrow, hidden passage, emerging into a vast, subterranean cavern. The air here was thick with the smell of damp earth and something else, something ancient and unsettling. Strange, ethereal figures, the ghosts of the Gi tribe, flickered in the dim light, their silent, mournful presence a chilling testament to a long-forgotten battle.

"As you can see," Bugenhagen explained, his voice echoing in the cavernous space, "this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon. It was unfortunate that the Gi were larger than us. If they attacked through here, we wouldn't have stood a chance." He led them deeper into the cavern, past a series of gruesome, petrified figures, their bodies frozen in attitudes of combat. "This warrior went through the cave all alone," Bugenhagen continued, his gaze fixed on a particularly imposing figure, its stone face a mask of defiant courage. "Fighting attackers one after another..."

"Grandpa...... That warrior..." Nanaki began, his voice trembling.

"Ho Ho Hoooo... We're almost there," Bugenhagen replied, his eyes twinkling with a strange, almost sorrowful amusement.

They emerged into a final, vast chamber, its entrance blocked by a grotesque, leering face carved into the rock. "What is this......?" Bugenhagen exclaimed, his usual jovial demeanor replaced by a sudden, palpable fear. "After death... The ghosts of the Gi... Like stagnant air...... This... can't be!!"

The leering face animated, its stone eyes glowing with a malevolent light. Gi Nattak, the ancient, powerful chieftain of the Gi tribe, its spirit bound to this place by a centuries-old curse, rose to confront them. The ensuing battle was a desperate, terrifying affair, the Gi Nattak’s spectral attacks a chilling reminder of the canyon’s bloody, violent past. But Cloud, Barret, and Nanaki, fueled by a desperate courage, fought with a savage intensity, their combined strength finally vanquishing the ancient, malevolent spirit.

"Thank you, Cloud," Bugenhagen said, his voice trembling with relief. "Because of you, we survived. Nanaki, you have grown strong, too."

Nanaki’s gaze was fixed on the petrified warrior, a dawning understanding in his Mako-green eyes. "......Oh yeah?"

"Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here..." Bugenhagen continued, his voice gentle. "Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here." He led them through a narrow passage at the back of the chamber, emerging onto a windswept precipice overlooking a vast, desolate canyon. And there, silhouetted against the bruised, Mako-stained sky, stood a lone, petrified figure, its gaze fixed on the distant, unseen horizon.

"This is..." Nanaki whispered, his voice choked with a mixture of awe and a dawning, heartbreaking realization.

"...The warrior who fought against the Gi," Bugenhagen explained, his voice soft but firm. "He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon. But he was never able to return to town... Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto."

Nanaki stared, his Mako-green eyes wide with a mixture of disbelief and a dawning, unbearable grief. "That... That's...... Seto...?"

"Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here," Bugenhagen continued, his voice a gentle eulogy. "...To protect this Canyon. Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to stone...... Even after they all ran away... Seto, continued to protect us. And he continues to protect us, even now."

"Even now..." Nanaki echoed, his voice a broken whisper.

"You thought that he was a coward and ran away," Bugenhagen said, his gaze fixed on Nanaki. "But he, alone risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon. That is your father, Seto."

Nanaki’s legs trembled, his massive frame shaking with a grief that was centuries in the making. "That...... that is Seto? ...!? Did mother know?"

"Ho Ho Hoooo... She knew," Bugenhagen replied, a sad smile on his lips. "The two of them made me promise to keep this cave shut. They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul. They said we should forget about this cave."

Nanaki sank to his knees, his fiery mane brushing against the cold, unforgiving stone. He looked up at the petrified figure of his father, a single, crystalline tear tracing a path down his furry cheek. "Seto....... Fa... Father..." He threw back his head and let out a long, mournful howl, a sound that echoed through the silent, windswept canyon, a heartbreaking lament for a father he had never known, for a sacrifice he had never understood.

Cloud and Barret retreated, leaving Nanaki and Bugenhagen alone with their grief, and with the silent, stoic presence of Seto, the forgotten hero of Cosmo Canyon. The weight of the past, of a father’s love and a son’s misplaced anger, hung heavy in the air, a poignant reminder of the enduring power of sacrifice, and the redemptive power of truth.

Later, as the first faint rays of dawn painted the canyon walls in hues of crimson and gold, Nanaki rejoined Cloud and the others, his Mako-green eyes shining with a newfound resolve. "Wait for me! I'm coming too!" he declared, his voice strong and clear.

Bugenhagen, his ancient eyes twinkling with a proud, paternal affection, nodded. "Cloud. Please look after Nanaki."

"What happened?" Cloud asked, sensing the profound change in his young friend.

Nanaki’s gaze was fixed on the distant, snow-capped peaks of the northern mountains. "I think I grew up a little. That's what happened!" He turned and bounded down the stairs, his earlier sorrow replaced by a fierce, unwavering determination. He was Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon, son of the warrior Seto. And he would not rest until the Planet, his wounded, dying Planet, was safe.

<div id="chapter-20"></div>

# Chapter 20: The Rebuilt Nightmare

The journey north from Cosmo Canyon was a somber, contemplative affair. The truth of Seto’s sacrifice had profoundly affected Nanaki, his youthful exuberance now tempered by a quiet, determined resolve. Cloud, too, found himself wrestling with his own fragmented past, the chilling encounter with Sephiroth in Kalm, the unsettling revelations about Jenova, all swirling in his mind, a chaotic maelstrom of doubt and uncertainty.

They crossed a shallow river, the buggy’s engine sputtering in protest, and found themselves in a familiar, yet strangely alien, landscape. The jagged peaks of Mt. Nibel loomed before them, a stark, imposing silhouette against the bruised, Mako-stained sky. And nestled at its base, a place Cloud had sworn was consumed by fire and death five years prior, was Nibelheim.

"What--!!" Tifa gasped, her voice a choked whisper, her eyes wide with a mixture of disbelief and a dawning, visceral fear. "This was all supposed to be burnt down, right?" She turned to Cloud, her gaze searching, her hand instinctively reaching for his.

Cloud’s own heart pounded in his chest, a cold dread seeping into his Mako-infused veins. "...I thought so."

"Then why...?" Tifa’s voice trailed off, her gaze sweeping over the eerily intact village. "My house is still there too..."

Barret’s usual bluster was replaced by a stunned, bewildered silence. "The hell's goin' on!? This a dream or somethin'?"

Aeris’s Mako-green eyes, usually so bright with an enigmatic wisdom, were clouded with a troubled uncertainty. "...somthing's strange?"

Nanaki, his senses acute, his fiery mane bristling with a primal unease, rumbled, "I wonder what's going on..."

Cloud’s mind reeled. He remembered the fire, the searing heat, the stench of burning flesh, the screams of the dying… He remembered Sephiroth, his silver hair a stark contrast to the crimson flames, his eyes burning with an unholy light, his laughter a chilling symphony of madness and destruction. How could Nibelheim still stand? How could his memories, so vivid, so visceral, be so utterly, terrifyingly, wrong?

"I'm not lying!" he insisted, his voice tight with a desperate conviction. "I remember... the intense heat of the flames..."

They entered the village, a place of unsettling, almost surreal normalcy. The inn, the general store, Cloud’s own childhood home, Tifa’s house… all stood as they had five years prior, untouched by the inferno that had seared itself into Cloud’s memory. The villagers, their faces strangely blank, their eyes devoid of recognition, went about their daily routines, oblivious to the intruders in their midst.

"Sir, don't say such awful things," the innkeeper admonished when Cloud questioned him about the fire. "I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened."

Tifa’s voice was a choked whisper. "You're lying..."

In the kitchen of the inn, they found a hunched figure in a black cloak, his face obscured by shadows, a crudely tattooed number "6" visible on his neck. "Urrr...... rrrrr...... rrrgh... must... go... to... Re... uni... on..." he muttered, his voice a low, guttural growl. He clutched a small, glowing orb – a Luck Source – which Cloud, his senses on high alert, quickly pocketed.

Another cloaked figure, this one bearing the number "12," huddled near the furnace in the general store. "Can...... you...... hear? The... voice... of... Se... phi... ro... th......" he rasped, before collapsing, leaving behind a shimmering Elixir.

The pattern repeated itself throughout the village. Cloaked figures, their bodies emaciated, their minds clearly unhinged, each bearing a numbered tattoo, each muttering cryptic pronouncements about a "Reunion" and the "Great Sephiroth." They were like broken puppets, their strings pulled by an unseen, malevolent hand.

In Tifa’s house, the familiar surroundings a jarring contrast to the unsettling presence of the cloaked figures, Cloud found himself drawn to her piano. "...I definitely remember playing the piano then," he mused, his brow furrowed in concentration. "But why didn't it get burnt down?" He sat at the keyboard, his fingers moving hesitantly over the keys, picking out a simple, haunting melody – the theme song of their shared, and now increasingly suspect, past. As the last notes faded, a small, hidden compartment in the piano sprang open, revealing a single, tarnished gil – Tifa’s secret savings, a poignant reminder of a childhood that now seemed a distant, almost forgotten dream.

On Tifa’s desk, a typewritten report lay open, its contents chillingly mundane: _"Periodic Report to Professor Hojo. 1. Clone Activity Report: Unfortunately, no 'CLONES' have left this town this quarter. As previously reported, the 'CLONES' seem to be sensing something. But all they say is, 'reunion' or 'Sephiroth' and show no other signs of activity. 2. Confidentiality Report: A total of eight people have visited this town this quarter. Fortunately, none knew about the incident five years ago. Therefore, no one knows the town was restored exactly as it was five years ago. Our staff, disguised as townspeople have improved their acting skills, and we do not report any problems at this time. That is all."_

Clones… Shinra staff disguised as townspeople… The pieces began to fall into place, forming a picture that was both horrifying and strangely, perversely, logical. Nibelheim had been rebuilt, its inhabitants replaced, its history rewritten, all to conceal the truth of Sephiroth’s madness, of Shinra’s horrific experiments. And Cloud, his own memories a tangled web of lies and half-truths, was somehow, inextricably, at the heart of it all.

Their investigation led them, inevitably, to the Shinra mansion, a place of dark secrets and forbidden knowledge, its decaying grandeur a testament to a past that refused to stay buried. Outside, two more cloaked figures stood vigil, their voices a chorus of insane, reverent whispers. "Wooooo-----ooow...... He's... calling...... Sephiroth...... is...... calling......" "The... Great... Se... phi...... roth...... is... near...... In... side...... inside... the Mansion...... Urrrrrrrgh...... the great...... Sephi...... roth."

Inside, the air was thick with the smell of dust and decay, the silence broken only by the creak of rotting floorboards and the distant, mournful sigh of the wind. A letter, left conspicuously on a dusty table, spoke of a "scientifically altered" Turk, "put to sleep in the basement," and a "game" involving a safe and a series of cryptic clues.

Driven by a desperate need for answers, Cloud and his companions descended into the mansion’s subterranean depths, a labyrinth of cobweb-strewn corridors and forgotten laboratories. They found the safe, its combination hidden in a series of riddles scattered throughout the mansion. After a tense, heart-pounding battle with the safe’s monstrous guardian, the Lost Number, they retrieved the "Key to the Basement," a tarnished, unassuming object that held the promise of unlocking yet another layer of Nibelheim’s dark, twisted secrets.

The key led them to a hidden chamber, its walls lined with rows of ornate, velvet-lined coffins. And in the center of the room, its lid securely fastened, was a single, imposing sarcophagus. A chilling premonition washed over Cloud. He knew, with a certainty that transcended logic, that whatever lay within that coffin held a vital piece of the puzzle, another clue to the mystery of his own fragmented past, and to the terrifying enigma that was Sephiroth.

With a deep breath, he approached the sarcophagus, his hand reaching for the lid, his heart pounding a frantic rhythm against his ribs. The truth, he sensed, was close. And it was a truth that threatened to shatter not only his own fragile sense of self, but the very foundations of the world he thought he knew.

# Chapter 21: Dreams of Flight

The lid of the central coffin creaked open, revealing a figure within, pale and still, as if carved from marble. He was handsome, in a dark, brooding way, his black hair swept back from a high forehead, his features sharp and aristocratic. A crimson cloak was draped over his still form. As Cloud and his companions watched, the figure’s eyes snapped open, revealing irises the color of blood.

"...To wake me from the nightmare," he rasped, his voice a low, gravelly whisper. He sat up, his movements stiff, as if unaccustomed to waking. "Who is it!?" His gaze, intense and unsettling, swept over them. "...Never seen you before. You must leave."

"You were having a nightmare," Cloud stated, a strange sense of empathy, of shared torment, resonating within him.

The figure – Vincent, as he would later introduce himself – scoffed, a humorless, self-deprecating sound. "Hmph... a nightmare...? My long sleep has given me time to atone."

"What are you saying?" Cloud pressed, intrigued despite himself.

"I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out." Vincent’s voice was cold, dismissive. "This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare."

"...you can say that again," Cloud muttered, the truth of Vincent’s words a chilling echo of his own fragmented, terrifying memories.

Vincent’s crimson eyes narrowed. "Hmm? What do you know?" He gestured for Cloud to speak. "You start first."

Cloud recounted their story, his voice a monotone recital of their desperate pursuit of Sephiroth, of the Nibelheim incident, of Jenova, of the unsettling mystery of the cloaked figures and the impending Reunion. Vincent listened in silence, his expression unreadable, his crimson gaze fixed on Cloud with an unnerving intensity.

"So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago?" Vincent finally spoke, his voice a low, contemplative rumble. "And about the Jenova Project? ...He was missing, but has just recently reappeared. He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land." He paused, then asked, his voice laced with a strange, almost sorrowful curiosity, "Now it's your turn."

But Vincent remained elusive, his secrets, like his long, unnatural slumber, shrouded in a frustrating, impenetrable mystery. "Sorry... I cannot speak," he stated, his crimson eyes clouded with an unspoken, ancient grief. "Hearing your stories, has added upon me yet another sin. More nightmares shall come to me now, more than I previously had." He lay back down in his coffin, his form once again still and lifeless. "Now... please leave."

Cloud, however, was not so easily deterred. "Who are you?" he pressed. "At least tell us your name."

Vincent sighed, a sound like the rustling of dry leaves. "I was with... the Shinra Manufacturing Department in Administrative Research, otherwise known as--the Turks... Vincent."

"The Turks!?" Cloud exclaimed, his mind reeling. Another Turk… another piece of the puzzle…

"Formerly of the Turks," Vincent corrected, his voice a low, weary whisper. "I have no affiliation with Shinra now. ...And you?"

"Cloud, formerly of SOLDIER."

Vincent’s crimson eyes flickered with a sudden, intense interest. "You were also with Shinra...? Then do you know Lucrecia?"

"Who?"

"......Lucrecia." Vincent’s voice was barely audible, his gaze distant, lost in some private, sorrowful reverie. "The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth."

Cloud’s breath hitched. "...gave birth...? Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?"

"That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory," Vincent explained, his voice tinged with a deep, abiding sadness. "He was born from a beautiful lady. That lady was Lucrecia. She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful... Lucrecia."

"...A human experiment?" Cloud asked, a chilling premonition washing over him.

Vincent nodded, his crimson eyes clouded with an ancient, unbearable grief. "There was no way to cancel the experiment. I couldn't stop her. That was my sin. I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst." He closed his eyes, his face a mask of tormented resignation. "Let me sleep..."

But Cloud, his own past so inextricably linked to Shinra’s horrific experiments, could not let it go. "Wait!" he urged, his voice urgent. "If I go with you will I meet Hojo?"

Vincent’s eyes snapped open, a flicker of something fierce, something predatory, in their crimson depths. "Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later..."

Vincent sat up, his movements surprisingly fluid, his crimson cloak swirling around him. "Lucrecia... All right. I've decided to go with you." He rose from his coffin, a figure of a dark, brooding enigma, his motives, like his past, shrouded in a tantalizing, and perhaps dangerous, mystery. "Being a former Turk, I may be of help to you..."

With their newest, and strangest, companion in tow, they ascended from the mansion’s subterranean depths, emerging into the eerie, unnatural stillness of the rebuilt Nibelheim. The cloaked figures still roamed the streets, their muttered pronouncements about the "Reunion" and the "Great Sephiroth" a constant, unsettling reminder of the madness that had consumed their world.

They found Sephiroth – or rather, another of his Jenova-controlled apparitions – in the mansion’s hidden library, the very place where his descent into madness had begun. "Being here brings back memories," the Sephiroth-phantom mused, his voice a chilling echo of the original. "Are you going to participate in the Reunion?"

"I don't even know what a Reunion is!" Cloud retorted, his hand instinctively reaching for the Buster Sword.

"Jenova will be at the Reunion," the phantom explained, its Mako-green eyes glittering with an unholy light. "Jenova will join the Reunion becoming a calamity from the skies."

"Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient!?" Cloud exclaimed, his mind reeling.

The phantom chuckled, a dry, humorless sound. "...I see. I don't think you have the right to participate. I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to find out... then follow..." With a final, mocking smile, it threw a shimmering orb of Materia at Cloud – a "Destruct" Materia, its destructive potential a chilling testament to Sephiroth’s malevolent intent – and then, with a whisper of displaced air, it vanished, leaving Cloud and his companions to grapple with the terrifying implications of its cryptic pronouncements.

Reunion… Jenova, a calamity from the skies… The pieces of the puzzle were slowly, agonizingly, beginning to fall into place, forming a picture that was far more horrifying, far more complex, than any of them could have imagined. Their pursuit of Sephiroth, Cloud realized, was not just a quest for revenge, or for answers. It was a desperate race against time, a battle against a darkness that threatened to consume not only their own fragile lives, but the very fate of the Planet itself.

They left Nibelheim, the rebuilt nightmare a chilling testament to Shinra’s duplicity and Sephiroth’s madness, and ventured once more into the treacherous, snow-swept expanse of Mt. Nibel. The air was thin and biting, the silence broken only by the crunch of their boots on the frozen ground and the distant, mournful howl of the wind.

Their journey led them to Rocket Town, a small, unassuming village nestled at the foot of a towering, rust-encrusted rocket, a forgotten relic of Shinra’s abandoned space program. The town, like its namesake, seemed to be slowly, inexorably, succumbing to the ravages of time and neglect, its inhabitants a collection of grizzled mechanics and dreamers, their lives forever bound to the fate of the rusting behemoth that dominated their skyline.

Here, amidst the grease-stained workshops and the fading dreams of interstellar travel, they encountered Cid Highwind, a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed pilot with a heart of gold and a spirit as indomitable as the rocket he had once hoped to command. Cid, a man whose dreams of reaching the stars had been shattered by Shinra’s capricious whims and the well-intentioned, if ultimately misguided, actions of his loyal assistant, Shera, was initially resistant to their pleas for help. But when Rufus Shinra himself arrived, his arrogant pronouncements and casual disregard for Cid’s past a stark reminder of Shinra’s callous indifference, Cid’s simmering resentment finally boiled over.

"What the......! You got me all excited for nothing!?" Cid roared, his voice a gravelly explosion of frustration and long-suppressed anger. "Then, what'd you come here for?"

"I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco," Rufus stated, his tone one of bored, aristocratic disdain. "We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction. But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane..."

Cid’s face contorted in a mask of rage. "&^\#^%\! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco. Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?"

The ensuing confrontation was a chaotic, almost comical affair, Palmer, Rufus’s portly, sycophantic underling, attempting to commandeer the Tiny Bronco, Cid and his newfound companions fighting to defend it. In the end, they found themselves unlikely passengers aboard the small, propeller-driven plane, its engine sputtering, its wings riddled with Shinra bullets, as it made a desperate, water-logged escape from Rocket Town, Cid’s dreams of flight, and their own pursuit of Sephiroth, taking an unexpected, and decidedly amphibious, turn.

"She won't fly anymore..." Cid lamented, his voice tinged with a weary resignation as the Tiny Bronco, now more boat than plane, drifted aimlessly on the vast, indifferent ocean.

"Can't we use it as a boat?" Cloud asked, ever the pragmatist.

Cid sighed, a plume of cigarette smoke escaping his lips. "$\#&%\! Do whatever you want!" He paused, then asked, his gaze sweeping over their small, eclectic group, "What're you guys gonna do?"

"We're going after a man named Sephiroth," Cloud explained, his voice grim. "We'll have to get Rufus of the Shinra someday too."

Cid’s eyes lit up with a sudden, reckless gleam. "I don't know about any of that, but... What the hell!? Sign me up!"

And so, their party grew once more, their numbers bolstered by the addition of a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed pilot with a heart of gold and a dream that refused to die. Their vessel, the battered, water-logged Tiny Bronco, was a far cry from Cid’s beloved Highwind, but it was a means of transport, a fragile symbol of their shared, desperate hope. Their destination, the Temple of the Ancients, a place of myth and legend, a place where, it was said, the secrets of the Planet, and perhaps the key to defeating Sephiroth, lay hidden. The journey, Cloud knew, was far from over. It was, in fact, just beginning.

<div id="chapter-22"></div>

# Chapter 22: The Materia Hunter

The Tiny Bronco, now more a makeshift raft than an aircraft, chugged its way across the vast, shimmering expanse of the ocean. The sun beat down relentlessly, the salt spray a constant, stinging reminder of their precarious situation. Cid, his usual gruff demeanor softened by a grudging respect for their shared predicament, managed to coax a surprising amount of speed from the battered plane’s sputtering engine, his knowledge of mechanics proving invaluable.

"Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth towards the Temple of the Ancients," Cid mused, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon. "That numskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'... so maybe it's off this way?" He gestured towards the west, towards a chain of mist-shrouded islands that rose from the turquoise waters like forgotten, slumbering beasts.

"Let's just head for land and get some information," Cloud suggested, his own mind still reeling from the unsettling revelations of Nibelheim and the cryptic pronouncements of Sephiroth’s phantom. "Temple of the Ancients... that name bothers me."

Yuffie, who had been surprisingly subdued since their watery escape from Rocket Town, suddenly perked up. ".........Hm. How 'bout goin' west? No, no reason. NO reason at all!" she insisted, a little too vehemently.

Cloud exchanged a wary glance with Tifa. Yuffie’s sudden, inexplicable enthusiasm was, to say the least, suspicious. But they had no other leads, no other direction to pursue. And so, with a shared, unspoken understanding, they steered the Tiny Bronco towards the western islands, towards the mist-shrouded land of Wutai.

Wutai, when they finally reached it, was a place of breathtaking, almost mystical beauty. Towering, pagoda-style buildings, their gracefully curved roofs adorned with intricate carvings, rose from amidst a lush, verdant landscape. Cherry blossoms, their delicate pink petals a stark contrast to the vibrant green of the surrounding jungle, drifted on the gentle breeze, painting the air with a fleeting, ethereal beauty. It was a place of ancient traditions, of forgotten gods, of a proud, warrior heritage that had, in recent years, been overshadowed by the encroaching influence of Shinra and the seductive allure of tourism.

Their arrival, however, was anything but peaceful. As they made their way along a winding, mountain path, Yuffie, her earlier subdued demeanor replaced by a strange, almost manic energy, suddenly darted ahead, her small frame a blur of motion. "Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!" she yelled, positioning herself in their path, her eyes glittering with a mischievous, unsettling light.

Barret, his patience already worn thin by their arduous journey and Yuffie’s increasingly erratic behavior, scowled. "What!? The hell happened, all of a sudden!?"

"I know this area pretty well," Yuffie declared, her voice a little too bright, a little too innocent. "It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready..."

Aeris’s Mako-green eyes narrowed in suspicion. "......Hmmm...... Something's fishy... You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?"

Before Yuffie could reply, a squad of Shinra soldiers burst from the undergrowth, their weapons at the ready. "There they are, catch 'em!!" one of them barked.

Cloud’s hand instinctively went to the hilt of the Buster Sword. "Shinra!?"

The lead soldier, his face a mask of confusion, peered at them. "Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!"

Tifa’s gaze, sharp and accusing, fixed on Yuffie. "Yuffie, you're not......!"

"I didn't know!" Yuffie insisted, her voice a little too shrill. "I have nothing to do with this one!"

Nanaki’s fiery mane bristled. "What do you mean 'this one' 'THIS one'! So you were concocting some evil scheme!!"

Yuffie stammered, "No, umm, uh......"

The Shinra soldiers, their initial confusion replaced by a brutish, indiscriminate aggression, charged. "What should we do!? Uh...... Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!"

In the ensuing chaos, Yuffie, with a speed and agility that belied her small stature, disappeared into the dense jungle foliage, leaving Cloud and his companions to deal with the Shinra assault. The battle was short and brutal, their frustration and anger at Yuffie’s betrayal fueling their attacks.

As the last Shinra soldier fell, a chilling realization washed over them. "What's going on!?" Tifa exclaimed, her hand flying to her belt, where her Materia orbs usually resided. "I thought something was fishy... My, my materia is missing!!"

A collective gasp of dismay echoed through the group. Their Materia, their precious, hard-won sources of power, were gone. Stolen. By Yuffie.

"That &\*&$ kid!!!" Barret roared, his voice a raw, anguished cry of fury and betrayal. "She was after our materia from the start!! She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our materia back! C'mon! We're goin' after her!"

Their pursuit of Yuffie led them to Wutai village, a place of quiet, traditional beauty, its inhabitants seemingly oblivious to the turmoil that raged beyond their peaceful borders. They found Yuffie easily enough, her attempts at concealment comically inept. She led them on a merry chase through the village, her taunts and evasions a frustrating, infuriating dance.

Their search for Yuffie, and their stolen Materia, brought them into contact with the eccentric, and often enigmatic, inhabitants of Wutai. They encountered the Turks – Reno, Rude, and Elena – on an uncharacteristic, and decidedly unwelcome, vacation, their presence a jarring reminder of Shinra’s pervasive influence. They met Lord Godo, Yuffie’s estranged father, a once-proud warrior now reduced to a disillusioned, world-weary recluse, his spirit broken by Wutai’s defeat in the war against Shinra.

And they encountered Don Corneo. The lecherous, corpulent slumlord, having somehow escaped his well-deserved plunge into the Midgar sewers, had, it seemed, found a new, and equally unsavory, hobby: kidnapping young women. Yuffie, in her reckless pursuit of… well, whatever it was Yuffie was pursuing… had inadvertently stumbled into Corneo’s clutches, along with, much to Reno’s chagrin, Elena of the Turks.

An uneasy, and decidedly temporary, truce was forged between Cloud’s party and the Turks, their shared desire to rescue their respective companions, and to exact a measure of revenge on the despicable Corneo, overriding their usual animosity. Their combined assault on Corneo’s mountain hideout, a bizarre, pagoda-style structure known as Da-chao, was a chaotic, action-packed affair, culminating in a final, rooftop confrontation with Corneo and his new, and equally grotesque, pet, Rapps.

Corneo, his usual bluster deflating in the face of their combined fury, was unceremoniously dispatched by Reno, his pleas for mercy falling on deaf, and decidedly unsympathetic, ears. Yuffie and Elena were rescued, their earlier animosity momentarily forgotten in a shared sense of relief and a mutual, if unspoken, respect.

Back in Wutai village, Yuffie, her bravado somewhat deflated, reluctantly returned their stolen Materia. "Phew, perfect," she declared, a little too brightly. "Now the materia is back in its rightful place."

Cloud, however, was not amused. "Hey... the placement of it is all messed up."

Yuffie waved a dismissive hand. "Huh? Oh, it'll be all right... Don't be so picky! Anyways, that sure was close...... No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!" She paused, then added, her voice tinged with a surprising, almost genuine remorse, "That Corneo guy's a real pain. I'd rather deal with my dad than deal with that guy."

Her "dad," Lord Godo, however, had other plans. Yuffie, it seemed, had a final trial to face, a challenge to her skill and her spirit, a test of her worthiness to carry the legacy of Wutai’s proud, warrior heritage. She ascended the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods, a towering, five-storied structure that served as a shrine to Wutai’s ancient deities, and a training ground for its most promising warriors. One by one, she faced the pagoda’s guardians...

TO BE CONTINUED...
